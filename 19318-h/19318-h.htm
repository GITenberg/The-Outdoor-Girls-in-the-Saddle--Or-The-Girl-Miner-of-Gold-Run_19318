<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>A SUMMER IN THE SADDLE</h3>


<p>"Hello, hello! Oh, what is the matter with
central!"</p>

<p>The dark-haired, pink-cheeked girl at the telephone
jiggled the receiver impatiently while a
straight line of impatience marred her pretty
mouth.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear!"</p>

<p>"At last! Is that you, Mollie Billette? I've
been trying to get you for the last half hour.
What's that? You've been home all morning
twiddling your thumbs and wondering what to
do with yourself? Of course! I knew it was
central's fault all the time! Now listen! Goodness,
what are you having over at your house?
A jazz dance or something? I can hardly hear
you speak for the noise."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't a dance," came back Mollie's voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
wearily from the other end of the wire. "It's
just the twins. They want to talk to you. Hold
the wire a minute while I shut them in the other
room."</p>

<p>Followed a silence during which Betty Nelson
could distinctly hear the wails of Mollie's little
brother and sister as they were ushered forcibly
into an adjoining room. Then Mollie's voice
again at the phone.</p>

<p>"Hello," she said. "Still there, Betty? Guess
I can hear you a little better now. Mother's out,
and I've been taking care of the twins. Just
rescued the cat from being dumped head down
in the flour barrel."</p>

<p>"Sounds natural," laughed the dark-haired,
pink-cheeked one, as she visualized Mollie's little
brother and sister, Dodo and Paul. They were
twins, and always in trouble.</p>

<p>"Anything special you called up about?" asked
Mollie's voice from the other end of the wire.
"Want to go for a ride or something?"</p>

<p>"Not the kind of ride you mean," said the
brown-eyed, pink-cheeked one, with a knowing
little smile on her lips.</p>

<p>At the lilt in her voice Mollie, at her end of
the wire, sat up and stared inquiringly into the
black mouth of the telephone.</p>

<p>"Betty," she said hopefully, "you are hiding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
something from me. You have something up
your sleeve."</p>

<p>"You're right and wrong," giggled Betty.
"I'm hiding something from you, but I can't get
it up my sleeve, it's too big!"</p>

<p>"Hurry up!" commanded Mollie in terrific accents.
"Are you going to tell me what's on your
mind, Betty Nelson?"</p>

<p>"When will you be around?" countered Betty.</p>

<p>"In five minutes."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>"Betty, wait! Is it good news?"</p>

<p>"The best ever," and Betty rang off.</p>

<p>She twinkled at the telephone for a minute,
then called another number.</p>

<p>"That you, Gracie?"</p>

<p>The fair-haired, tall, and very graceful girl at
the other end of the wire acknowledged that it
was.</p>

<p>"Please suggest something interesting, Betty,"
she added plaintively, as she took a chocolate
from the ever-present candy box and nibbled on
it discontentedly. "I woke up with the most awful
attack of the blues this morning."</p>

<p>"What, with a whole summer full of blessed
idleness before you?" mocked Betty.</p>

<p>"Too much idleness," grumbled Grace.
"That's the trouble."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Enter," said Betty drolly, "Doctor Elizabeth
Nelson."</p>

<p>Grace digested this remark for a moment, staring
at the telephone in much the same manner
as Mollie had done a few minutes before. Then
she swallowed the last of her chocolate in such
haste that it almost choked her.</p>

<p>"Betty," she said, "I have heard you use that
tone before. Is there really something in the
wind?"</p>

<p>"Come and see," said Betty and a click at the
other end of the wire told Grace that the conversation
was over.</p>

<p>"Oh bother!" she cried, her pretty forehead
drawn into a frown. "Now I suppose I've got
to get dressed and go over there before I can
find out what she meant."</p>

<p>In the hall she nearly ran into her mother,
who was dressed to go out. Mrs. Ford was a
handsome woman, prominent in the social circles
of Deepdale. She was kindly and sympathetic,
and all who knew her loved her.</p>

<p>So now, as she regarded her mother, a loving
smile erased the frown from Grace's forehead.</p>

<p>"I declare, Mother, you look younger than I
do," she said fondly. "Whither away so early?"</p>

<p>"The art club, this morning," replied Mrs.
Ford, her eyes approving the fair prettiness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
her daughter. "Are you going out? I thought
you were deep in that new book."</p>

<p>"I was," said Grace, with a sigh for what might
have been. "But Betty called up and said she
wanted me to come over. There's something in
the wind, that's sure, but she wouldn't give me
even the teeniest little hint of what it was. I
wasn't going at first, but I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thought better of it," finished Mrs. Ford,
with a smile. "Better go," she added, as she
opened the door. "My experience with Betty
Nelson is that she usually has something interesting
to say. Good-by, dear. If any one should
'phone while you are here, will you tell them that
I shan't be back till late afternoon?"</p>

<p>Grace promised that she would and moved
slowly up the stairs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Amy Blackford, the last of the trio
to whom the dark-haired, pink-cheeked little person
who was Betty Nelson had telephoned, had
stopped merely to remove the apron from in front
of her pink-checked gingham dress and was now
flying along the two short blocks that separated
her house from the Nelsons'.</p>

<p>As for poor Mollie Billette, she was nearly distracted.
Torn with curiosity, as that young person
very often was, to know the facts that had
prompted Betty's early call, she yet could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
satisfy that curiosity. When she had told Betty
that she would be around in five minutes she had
fully meant to make that promise good. But&mdash;she
had forgotten the twins!</p>

<p>Upon entering the room where she had locked
them while she talked to Betty, she found a sight
that fairly took her breath away.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some one had left an open bottle
of ink on the table. One of the twins, deciding
to play "savages," had pounced upon the ink bottle
as a means of making the play more realistic!</p>

<p>"Oh, Dodo! Oh, Paul! How could you be so
naughty?" moaned Mollie, sinking to the floor,
while the tears of exasperation rolled down her
face.</p>

<p>"Paul did it," accused Dodo, waving a pudgy,
ink-stained little fist in the direction of her
brother. "He said, 'let's use this ink and play
we're savagers&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>It was upon this scene that Mollie's little
French-American mother, Mrs. Billette, came a
moment later.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" she cried, raising her hands in the
French gesture all French people know so well.
"What is this? Mollie, have you gone quite
mad?"</p>

<p>Whereupon Mollie shook the tears of woe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
from her eyes and explained to her mother just
what had happened.</p>

<p>"And I was in such a hurry to get to Betty's,"
she finished dismally. "I just know she has
something exciting to tell us. And now I don't
suppose I will get there for hours."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you will," said Mrs. Billette, with the
delicious, almost imperceptible, accent she had.
"The ink has not yet dried, and luckily there is
not much about the room. Run along, dear. I
fully realize," she added, with the smile that
made Mollie adore her, "that this, with you, is a
very important occasion."</p>

<p>"And you are the most precious mother in the
world!" cried Mollie, flinging young arms about
her mother and giving her a joyful hug. "I
might have known you would understand." And
before the words were fairly out of her mouth
she was flying up the stairs.</p>

<p>When she reached Betty's house at last, out of
breath but happy, she found that Grace and Amy
were there before her. She found them all, including
Betty, up in Betty's room, a pretty place
done in ivory and blue, awaiting her coming as
patiently as they could.</p>

<p>"Betty wouldn't tell us a thing until you came,"
was the greeting Grace flung at her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"So don't be surprised if you aren't very popular
around here," laughed Betty, sitting very
straight in her wicker chair, feet stretched out
and crossed in front of her, hands tightly clasped
in her lap. Her face was a pretty picture of
animation.</p>

<p>"Who cares for popularity?" cried Mollie, as
she flung her sport hat on the bed and turned to
face Betty. "Betty Nelson, bring out that surprise."</p>

<p>"Who said it was a surprise?" asked Betty
tantalizingly, but the next minute her face sobered
and she regarded the girls gravely.</p>

<p>"Girls," she said, "I think I see a chance for
the most glorious outing we have had yet. How
would you like&mdash;&mdash;" she paused and regarded
the expectant girls thoughtfully. "How would
you like a summer <i>in the saddle?</i>"</p>

<p>"In the saddle?" repeated Grace wonderingly,
but Mollie broke in with a quick:</p>

<p>"Betty, do you mean on horseback?"</p>

<p>"Real horses?" breathed Amy Blackford.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Betty, nodding. "That's just
exactly what I mean."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>GREAT HOPES</h3>


<p>"But where are we to do all this?" asked Grace
skeptically. "Is somebody giving away steeds
for the asking? Wake me up, somebody, when
Betty gets through dreaming."</p>

<p>"Keep still, you old wet blanket," cried Mollie.
"Can't you see Betty is really in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Never mind them," said Amy, leaning a little
breathlessly toward Betty. "Let them fight it
out between themselves. What is the great news,
Betty?"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> great news," said Betty radiantly. "Listen,
my children. Mother has received a legacy
from a great uncle that she had almost forgotten
she had."</p>

<p>"Money?" queried Grace, interested.</p>

<p>"No, that's the best part of it," said Betty.
"Oh, girls, it's a ranch, a great big beautiful
ranch in the really, truly west!"</p>

<p>"Honest-to-goodness, wild and woolly?" queried
Mollie, beaming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Better than that," answered Betty with the
same lilt to her voice that the girls had heard
over the telephone. "I shouldn't wonder if we
should find the real old-fashioned, movie kind of
cowboys there&mdash;sombreros, fur leggings, bandannas,
and all."</p>

<p>"But where," interrupted Mollie, who had been
waiting with more or less patience for Betty to
come to the point, "do we come in, in all this? I
fail to see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh hush," cried Betty, her eyes dancing.
"You interrupt entirely too much. Where do we
come in, she wants to know," she paused to bestow
a beaming glance on Grace and Amy.
"That's the biggest joke of all. Where do we
come in? Why, honey dear, we're the whole
show!"</p>

<p>"The whole show," they murmured, beginning
to see the light.</p>

<p>"You bet," said the brown-haired, rosy-checked
one slangily. "Now listen. I think I've about
argued mother and dad around to the point where
they'll agree to let us have the use of this wild
and woolly rancho for a real outdoor adventure.
How does that idea strike you?"</p>

<p>"Listen to the child," cried Mollie pityingly.
"Such a question!"</p>

<p>"It would be heavenly!" raved Grace. "Think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of riding around all day in fur leggings and a
sombrero. Wide hats are always becoming to
me," she added musingly.</p>

<p>The girls laughed and Betty threw a pillow at
her, missing her by a hair's breadth.</p>

<p>"You needn't worry about your hat," laughed
Betty. "Reckon there won't be anybody around
there to admire you but Indians and broncho
busters."</p>

<p>"Oh, aren't the boys coming?" Grace asked,
her disappointment in her voice.</p>

<p>"They haven't been asked, silly," Mollie interrupted
impatiently. "Tell me, Betty," she cried,
turning to the Little Captain. "Is it really certain
that we'll have this chance?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," admitted Betty, her bright face
sobering. "That's why I don't want you to get
too excited about it. You see," her voice lowered
confidentially, "dad might decide to sell it."</p>

<p>"Sell it!" they cried in dismay, and Grace
added, with a decision that made the girls laugh:</p>

<p>"Oh, he mustn't do that until the fall, anyway."</p>

<p>"All right, Gracie," said Betty, with a chuckle.
"I'll give dad his orders."</p>

<p>"But why does he want to sell it, Betty?" Amy
questioned.</p>

<p>"We-el," said the Little Captain slowly. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
see mother has already received an offer of fifteen
thousand dollars for it. There's a ranchman
out there, I think his name is John Josephs,
or some such name, who seems to want to get
hold of our ranch. So his lawyers have offered
mother fifteen thousand for it."</p>

<p>"That's a pretty good lot of money," said Amy
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," agreed Betty. "And dad seems to
think that the best thing mother could do would
be to take the money and get rid of the ranch.
He says it will be a sort of white elephant on our
hands, since there isn't very much chance of our
going out there to live," she ended, with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>"Well," said Grace, with an injured air, "I
don't see why you called us all over here just to
disappoint us. If your father is going to sell the
place, then we certainly sha'n't be able to make
ourselves beautiful with bandannas and picturesque
hats&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, but you did not let me finish," hissed
Betty, melodramatically. "We have one ally&mdash;my
mother."</p>

<p>"Your mother!" cried Mollie, eagerly. "Then
she doesn't want to sell the ranch?"</p>

<p>"Right, the first time," cried Betty hilariously.
"I think mother has a sneaking notion that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
might look pretty good in a cowboy make-up herself.
You see," she added, with a twinkle,
"mother has never had a chance to own a real
honest-to-goodness ranch before."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't she sweet!" cried Mollie fervently,
adding, as one to whom inspiration had come:
"I tell you what, Betty, we'll take her with us!"</p>

<p>"How sweet of you," drawled Grace. "Especially
since the ranch belongs to her!"</p>

<p>The other girls chuckled and Mollie looked
rather sheepish.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," she admitted, "I guess it would be a
case of her taking us along."</p>

<p>"And I don't envy her the job," said gentle
Amy unexpectedly, while the girls gazed their reproach.</p>

<p>"Betty," said Mollie, "there is one very important
thing that I would like to know."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm the original little information
bureau," Betty assured her. "What will you
have?"</p>

<p>"Does your dad really want to sell the ranch?
Or is your mother likely to win out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother always gets her way," said Betty
confidently, adding: "Besides, the ranch was left
to mother, you know, and not to dad. So really
she has the say about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, but she might change her mind," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Grace pessimistically. "Fifteen thousand dollars
is a lot of money, you know. She might decide
to sell the ranch, after all."</p>

<p>"Well," said Betty, with an air of importance
that the girls were quick to notice, "there is another
reason why mother will probably hold on to
the property, for a little while at least."</p>

<p>"Yes?" they queried eagerly.</p>

<p>"You see," Betty continued thoughtfully,
"mother has an idea that this John Josephs is a
little too anxious to buy the ranch. It's right up
in the gold region, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gold!" shrieked Mollie. "You never said a
word about gold, Betty Nelson! Do you mean
there may be gold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now she <i>is</i> getting interesting," admitted
Grace, shaken out of her usual calm.</p>

<p>"How romantic," murmured Amy, breathing
fast.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Betty ruefully. "That's what dad
says mother is&mdash;romantic! He says there isn't a
chance in a thousand that there is real gold anywhere
near that ranch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, woman, stop!" cried Mollie, with her
most tragic scowl. "Wouldst put an end to all
our dreams in one fell swoop&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Probably that is all we shall do&mdash;just dream,"
said Betty, insisting upon being practical. "It's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
an idea of mother's, that's all. But she is really
determined to see the ranch, at least, before she
makes up her mind whether to sell or not. In
fact," she hesitated, colored a little, then went on
bravely, "dad has decided to send Allen out there
to look up the title. There is some trouble
about that, I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, now we know why she is so anxious to
be a little cow girl," teased Grace, while the others
regarded Betty's pretty color gleefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, Betty, Betty!" cried Mollie, shaking her
head dolefully, "you are altogether hopeless!"</p>

<p>For Allen Washburn, of whom Betty had
spoken in connection with the ranch, was a very
promising young lawyer. Also this promising
young lawyer was very fond of Betty Nelson.
And while the girls are shaking their heads over
this fact a little time will be taken to describe the
Outdoor Girls to those readers who have not already
met them and to review briefly the many
and varied adventures they had had up to this
time.</p>

<p>Betty Nelson, dark-haired, dark-eyed, and
rosy-cheeked, was the natural leader of the four
Outdoor Girls, a fact which had led to her being
dubbed "Little Captain" by the adoring girls.
Betty's father, Charles Nelson, had made a good
deal of money in his manufacture of carpets, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Betty's mother was a very sweet lady whom the
name of Rose fitted exactly.</p>

<p>Next came Mollie Billette, dark-haired and
with snapping black eyes, who was almost as
French in her manner as her very French mother.</p>

<p>Readers of the present volume must already
feel very well acquainted with Grace Ford.
Grace was the Gibson type, tall and slender and
fair-haired and very pretty, with a decided liking
for looking in mirrors.</p>

<p>Last of the quartette came Amy Blackford.
Amy was the ward of John and Sarah Stonington,
and for a long time she had thought her own
name was Stonington. The mystery of her past
had been cleared up, however, and Amy had come
into her own. Shy, gentle, sweet, she was beloved
and protected by the more hardy and active
Betty and Mollie. And Amy, as shy girls
sometimes will, had begun to think very much of
Grace Ford's attractive brother, Will&mdash;which is
a reminder that it is time to introduce "the boys."</p>

<p>Allen Washburn and his open fondness for
Betty have already been spoken of. Allen was
tall, nearly six feet. Sunburned and handsome
of face and quick of action, Allen attracted every
one wherever he went. And, truly, Betty was
no exception to this rule! Allen had been one
of the first to volunteer his services to the good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
old army of the U. S. A., and while he had gone
over only a buck private, he had come back a
lieutenant.</p>

<p>There was Will Ford, Grace's brother, whom
Grace and Amy both adored. Will had been in
the secret service when our country entered the
war, and because of this he had been the victim
of considerable misunderstanding. Afterward
he had joined the army with the other boys.
This was after some skillful secret service work
that won the praise of the government, as well
as the fervent admiration of the boys and girls.</p>

<p>The other two boys were Frank Haley and
Roy Anderson who had come into the little group
because of their friendship for Will and Allen.
They were fine, clean-cut, likable boys, who had
come through the war with colors flying.</p>

<p>The young folks had lived all their lives in
Deepdale, a thriving little city with a population
of about fifteen thousand people and situated in
the heart of New York State. Deepdale was
situated on the Argono River, a beautiful and
romantic stream where pleasure craft of all sorts
disported themselves. A branch line of the railroad
connected with the main line directly to
what the four Outdoor Girls believed to be the
most wonderful of all cities, New York.</p>

<p>The name of "Outdoor Girls" had come to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
quartette from the fact that they invariably spent
their summer vacations, and winter holidays also,
in some sort of outdoor sport. They could ride,
swim, play tennis, drive, and, in fact, do everything
that is expected of the athletic young girl
of to-day.</p>

<p>They would never forget that first tramping
tour when they had tramped for miles over the
country, meeting with a great many unusual adventures
on the way, as related in the first volume
of this series, entitled, "The Outdoor Girls
of Deepdale." Nor those other times at Rainbow
Lake, in Florida, at Ocean View, and later
at Pine Island, where they had come across that
marvelous, mysterious gypsy cave.</p>

<p>Then had come the war with the boys on the
other side, and the girls doing their "bit" at a
Hostess House. And a little later what black
distress overwhelmed them, when Will Ford was
reported wounded and Allen's name was among
the missing! This all happened while they were
at Bluff Point taking a much-needed vacation
from their work at the Hostess House.</p>

<p>In the volume directly preceding this, entitled
"The Outdoor Girls at Wild Rose Lodge," the
girls had had same very exciting experiences.
An old man, Professor Dempsey, by name, who
had retired to a little log cabin in the woods to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
recover his health, had chanced to do the girls
a very great favor. Of course the girls were
grateful to him and were very much interested
when he told them of his two sons who were in
the war. Later, when the girls read of the death
of his two sons in the paper, they went to the
old man's lonely cabin in the woods, but found
themselves too late. According to a friendly
neighbor, the old man had become temporarily
insane at the terrible news, had wrecked his cabin
in an insane frenzy, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Later, at Wild Rose Lodge, the girls were
frightened several times by a strange apparition
lurking in the woods around the lodge and Moonlight
Falls, a beautiful fall of water not far from
the cottage where the girls were staying. Later
the boys came home from France and helped the
girls solve the mystery.</p>

<p>And now here was Betty proposing another
outing that promised to be more fun than any
the Outdoor Girls had had yet. No wonder that
in the clamor of their excited questions and answers
no one heard the telephone ringing noisily
in the hall.</p>

<p>Finally the Nelsons' maid came trudging up the
stairs to answer it herself.</p>

<p>"If I can hear myself think," she grumbled, as
she took the receiver from the hook. "With all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
them girls a-gabberin' an' a-talkin' at the top o'
their lungs. Hello&mdash;I can't hear you&mdash;you'll
have to talk louder&mdash;you don't know the noise
they is in this house. Miss Betty?&mdash;jus' a
minute&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A gen'leman to speak to you, Miss Betty,"
she announced a moment later, looking in on the
hilarious girls. "An' le's hope you can hear him
better'n I could, that's all," she grumbled, as
Betty pushed by her in the doorway and gave her
a friendly pat on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll keep quiet now, all right," she
said, with a laughing glance over her shoulder at
her chums. "They'll want to hear what I have
to say."</p>

<p>At which taunt the girls started such a dreadful
clamor that she really had all she could do to
hear Allen at the other end of the wire. Oh, yes,
it was Allen!</p>

<p>"Sech a noise," grumbled the maid, as she
trudged down the steps again. "I never did see
sech wild uns!"</p>

<p>"Hello, hello, Allen," called Betty into the telephone.
"The girls are here and&mdash;what's that?
At Walnut Street? All right, that will be fine.
I can't talk now. Tell you why later. Yes,
we'll be there. Don't be silly. Good-by!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Her face was flushed when she confronted the
girls again.</p>

<p>"The boys have a half holiday&mdash;it's Saturday,
you know," she told them, while they regarded
her mischievously. "And they want us to pick
them up in the car, get some lunch somewhere,
and make a day of it. I told him we would."</p>

<p>"By 'him' I suppose you mean Allen," said
Mollie, to which Betty ducked her a bow and the
other girls giggled. "I like their nerve wanting
us to pick them up. Why doesn't Frank come
for us in his big car?"</p>

<p>"Allen figured it would take too long for them
to come home and get it."</p>

<p>"My, they must be in a hurry to see us," said
Grace, with a simper that sent the girls off into
gales of laughter.</p>

<p>"Well," said Betty finally, "are you coming,
or are you not?"</p>

<p>For answer Mollie jumped up, pressed a hat
upon Grace's indignant head, handed Amy her
coat, and crushed her own sport hat down on her
dark hair.</p>

<p>"Be this our answer," she said dramatically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>ENTER PETER LEVINE</h3>


<p>It is to be feared that the boys did not have
as pleasant a time on that Saturday afternoon
motor drive as they had hoped to have. For,
whereas the girls should have showered their attentions
upon them, the boys, they insisted upon
talking about nothing but Gold Run Ranch, which
was the name of the property left to Mrs. Nelson
by her great uncle.</p>

<p>"You aren't very complimentary to us," Frank
grumbled, as he hunched himself over the wheel
of Mollie's car. "You seem mighty glad to go
out to this forsaken old ranch where you won't
see us for the whole summer."</p>

<p>"I guess we can stand it if you can," Mollie
responded lightly, which only caused him to
glower the more.</p>

<p>"Now I'll say Allen knew what he was doing
when he studied law," remarked Roy Anderson
gloomily, as he glanced over his shoulder at
young Allen Washburn, who was driving Betty's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
neat little roadster with Betty herself beside him.
"He sure falls in soft on this job."</p>

<p>"Meaning, I suppose," drawled Grace, "that he
will have the pleasure of our company at Gold
Run Ranch. Never mind, old boy, you needn't
look so dreadfully gloomy. Have a chocolate
and brace up."</p>

<p>"You give it to me," said Roy, laughing.
Grace obediently popped a large juicy one into his
mouth. It may be remarked that after this performance
he really did look more cheerful.</p>

<p>"Anyway, we'll be back sometime, I suppose,"
said Mollie, continuing on the subject that was
uppermost in her mind.</p>

<p>"Yes, if we don't run away with some of those
handsome cowboys," put in Amy, with a chuckle.
"Betty says they abound around Gold Run
Ranch."</p>

<p>The girls giggled, but Will looked fierce.</p>

<p>"You had better not," he said, and though his
look was for all the girls, Amy knew that the
words were for her. She colored prettily and
promised with her eyes that she wouldn't.</p>

<p>Grace caught this by-play as she munched a
chocolate grumpily. Adoring her brother Will
as she did, she had always been a little jealous of
his fancy for Amy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p><p>"Anyway, they don't have to be so silly in public,"
she told herself resentfully. As she roused
herself from her musing, she heard Mollie say,
with a laugh:</p>

<p>"Don't be surprised if we come home with our
pockets full of gold. Mrs. Nelson thinks there
is some of it about there."</p>

<p>"Oh, are you still talking about that silly old
ranch?" Grace broke in petulantly. "I don't
know why you are getting so excited about it
when there is more than a chance that we sha'n't
go at all."</p>

<p>"Hooray!" cried Frank, and stepped on the
accelerator.</p>

<p>Mollie, beside him, turned to look at him
coldly.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you feel that way about it, Frank
Haley," she said primly. "But I'm very sorry
to say we don't."</p>

<p>"Now, I have put my foot in it," cried Frank
ruefully, turning his irresistible smile full upon
her. "What shall I do to make up, Mollie?
Hold your hand or something?"</p>

<p>His free hand closed over hers, but she
snatched her own away with indignation that
ended in a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Tend to your knitting," she warned him.
"Didn't you see that we almost ran over that
dog?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>But however much they might joke about the
possibility of their not realizing their dreams for
the summer, the Outdoor Girls were really worried
about it, and the next few days were anxious
ones for them.</p>

<p>Suppose Mrs. Nelson should yield to her husband's
arguments and resolve to sell the ranch
after all? For awhile it almost seemed as though
she were about to do this very thing, and the suspense
nearly drove the girls frantic.</p>

<p>Then something happened to turn the tide
in their direction. And how the girls afterwards
blessed that loud-necktied, check-suited
man!</p>

<p>It was Betty who came to the door to admit
this angel in disguise, it being the hired girl's
day out. Her first glance at the stranger served
to stamp him as one of those loud-voiced,
flashily dressed persons commonly referred to as
"sports," and at this first glance Betty took a
violent dislike to him.</p>

<p>However, being accustomed to treat every one
with kindliness, she asked him gravely whom he
wished to see.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Nelson at home?" he asked ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," hesitated Betty, then her natural
courtesy getting the better of the dislike she felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
for this person, she added politely: "Won't you
come in? I will call mother."</p>

<p>With blandly murmured thanks the owner of
the checked suit stepped over the threshold, his
eyes still on Betty to such an extent that she was
glad to be able to slip upstairs out of his sight.</p>

<p>"Mother," she explained hurriedly, finding
that lady in her pretty dressing room, "there's a
horrid person downstairs who wants to see you.
I don't like his looks, and if you don't want to
see him I can tell him you aren't at home&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heavens, Betty, is he as bad as all that?"
asked Mrs. Nelson, as she rose hastily and gave
an automatic pat to her hair. "I hope he doesn't
steal the silver. You shouldn't have left him
alone, dear&mdash;&mdash;" and with these words she swept
out of the room and down the stairs.</p>

<p>Betty heard her greet the man, and then slipped
off to her own room and picked up some half-finished
embroidery.</p>

<p>"I hope he doesn't bother mother too much,"
she mused aloud. "I never saw a more unpleasant
looking person in my life. I wonder what
he can want, anyway."</p>

<p>It was fully half an hour later that she heard
the closing door downstairs that told her their
unwelcome visitor had left. A minute later her
mother herself opened the door of Betty's room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
looking so troubled and unsettled that Betty
jumped to her feet in quick alarm.</p>

<p>"Mother, did that man say anything to make
you feel bad?" she cried. "Because, if he
did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, dear," said Mrs. Nelson, sinking into
a chair, while her eyes sought the window
thoughtfully. "I am worried, that's all."</p>

<p>Betty drew a low chair over beside her mother,
and, sitting down, took Mrs. Nelson's hand in
both her own.</p>

<p>"Tell me, dear," she urged.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson drew her troubled gaze away from
the window and looked at the Little Captain intently.</p>

<p>"Betty," she said, "there is something strange
about this Gold Run Ranch of ours. This
man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" prompted Betty, as her mother paused.</p>

<p>"This man who called this morning wanted to
buy the ranch for a western client of his. It
seems this client is willing to pay me my own
price&mdash;within reasonable limits of course. He
seemed so strangely eager to make a deal with
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" prompted Betty again, beginning to
look worried herself.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Mrs. Nelson, "I decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
then and there that I wouldn't sell to anybody."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother!" Betty was all eagerness now,
"do you really mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Mrs. Nelson, determination
replacing uncertainty. "There must be something
unusual about Gold Run or John Josephs
and this man, too, wouldn't be so anxious to get
it away from me. I am certainly not going to
let them drive me into selling, until I see my
property at least."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Mother!" cried Betty enthusiastically.
"I've been fearfully worried for fear
you wouldn't see it that way. Did you tell the
man in the check suit that?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," said Mrs. Nelson, smiling as
she pressed Betty's hand. "Now you will see
what a schemer your mother is, my dear. I told
him I hadn't definitely decided yet on any course,
that I had already had a very good offer for my
ranch, and that he would have to see Allen Washburn,
our attorney. I wanted Allen to have a
chance to size this man up and see if he has the
same impression of him that I had."</p>

<p>"Mother," breathed Betty admiringly, "I think
you are wonderful." Then after a little pause,
she added shyly: "You really think a great deal
of&mdash;of Allen's ability, don't you, Mother?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do, dear," said Mrs. Nelson, stroking the
brown head gently. Then she added with a hint
of mischief in her voice: "Your father and I
have come to feel toward him almost as if he
were our son."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" murmured Betty, very faintly.</p>

<p>Two days went by&mdash;anxious ones for the girls.
In the Nelson home, this time in the pretty living
room, Allen Washburn was now a guest.</p>

<p>"Well," Mrs. Nelson said, with more than a
hint of eagerness in her voice, "what did you
think of our loudly-dressed friend, Allen?"</p>

<p>"Was he as bad as Mrs. Nelson's description
makes him out to be?" asked Mr. Nelson, smiling
genially through a cloud of cigar smoke.</p>

<p>Betty, in a corner of the lounge, was trying her
best to be calm while she waited eagerly for
Allen's reply.</p>

<p>"I don't know just how Mrs. Nelson described
this fellow to you, I'm sure," he answered, with
a smiling glance toward Betty's mother. "But
I'm quite sure that she didn't say anything bad
enough."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't like him either?" asked Mrs.
Nelson quickly.</p>

<p>"I neither liked him nor trusted him," Allen
replied decidedly, adding with a wry smile: "He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
calls himself Peter Levine, but I'm willing to
wager about anything I have that that isn't his
real name."</p>

<p>"You think he's a sharper then?" Mr. Nelson
interjected.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded Allen, his young face
earnestly intent. "He looks to me like one of
these confidence men who abound in the western
boom towns&mdash;men who can talk the other fellow
into putting his last cent into some 'sure thing.'
'Sure thing,'" he repeated disgustedly. "The
only sure thing about most of those schemes is
the certainty of 'going bust' and losing every
penny you have in the world."</p>

<p>"And yet," Mr. Nelson commented, "these
sharpers, 'confidence men,' as you call them, often
manage to keep just within the law."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Allen, "they manage to keep
the letter of the law&mdash;sometimes. But that is
just a caution to save their own necks. It's the
spirit of the law that they violate. But we are
getting away from the point," he added, pulling
himself up short with an apologetic smile toward
Mrs. Nelson. "We were speaking of this Peter
Levine. My summing up of him is that he is
entirely untrustworthy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson shot a triumphant glance at her
husband.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see?" she said. "I was sure Allen would
agree with me."</p>

<p>"Of course I may be mistaken," Allen continued,
rather hesitantly. "But I have a very distinct
impression, a sort of seventh sense we fellows
in the law game call it, that this Levine is
in league with John Josephs, the man that offered
you fifteen thousand for the ranch."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Nelson, startled. "How can
you know that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know it," Allen told her. "I only
suspect."</p>

<p>"Then what would you advise us to do?"</p>

<p>"Hold tight and not sell till you have had a
chance to look matters over on the ground&mdash;not
from a distance."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Nelson rising resignedly and
knocking the ashes from his cigar, "I suppose
that settles it. I shall have to leave my business
to go to smash," he added, with a chuckle, "while
I take my family into a barbarous land where
every second man you meet has designs on a well-filled
pocketbook&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he got no further, for Betty had run over
to him and turned him imperiously around till
his smiling eyes looked down into her gleeful
ones.</p>

<p>"Daddy," she cried, "do you really mean it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
We can all go to Gold Run&mdash;you and mother and
the girls? We'll have to have the girls, you
know!" she ended on a pleading note.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course," said Mr. Nelson resignedly.
"We will have to have the girls."</p>

<p>It was a very radiant Betty who, a few minutes
later, saw Allen Washburn to the door.</p>

<p>"And to think," she murmured, while Allen
smiled down at her, "that I didn't like that perfect
angel, Peter Levine, at first. Why, I should
have welcomed him with open arms!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Allen, taken by surprise.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" asked Betty, mischievously
wide-eyed. "If he hadn't happened along just
when he did our glorious adventure would have
dwindled into a might-have-been. Why, I could
love him for it."</p>

<p>"Good-night, I'm going!" ejaculated Allen, and
before Betty could gasp he had flung out of the
door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she called, laughter in
her voice.</p>

<p>"To kill Peter Levine," growled a voice out of
the darkness, and Betty, closing the door very
softly, chuckled to herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>AN IMITATION HOLD-UP</h3>


<p>It was all over. The bustling days of preparation
for the long trip, during which the girls had
hardly had time to give vent to their excitement,
had passed, and here they were actually finding
their places in the puffing, western bound train.</p>

<p>"Here's number five," Grace said, as she slid
into a velvet-covered seat with a sigh of thankfulness.
"Who is coming in here with me?"</p>

<p>"Guess I'm elected," laughed Betty. "And
here's number seven for Mollie and Amy, and
mother and dad are in six right across the way.
That completes the family party."</p>

<p>They were hardly settled when there was a last
warning cry of "All aboard" and the train began
to move ever so slowly from the station.</p>

<p>The girls peered out to wave good-by to the
boys and some of their other friends who had
come to see them off. The young fellows looked
rather gloomy&mdash;all except Allen. The latter
shouted something that they took to be "See you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
later!" and then the train swept around a curve,
hiding the station from view.</p>

<p>"Well," said Grace, with a sigh, as she opened
her grip to fish for the inevitable candy box, "the
boys seemed to take our flitting pretty hard.
They looked as if we were already dead and
buried."</p>

<p>"Far from it," murmured Betty happily, her
eyes on the ever changing view from the window.
"I feel as if we were just beginning to live."</p>

<p>The hours of the morning passed like minutes
to the girls, and they were surprised when the
porter came through with his "Foist call fo'
dinnah!"</p>

<p>The afternoon passed uneventfully, and they
amused themselves by making up stories about
their fellow passengers. There was the quaint
little man in number four who reminded them
of Professor Arnold Dempsey and who might
very easily have been a professor, judging from
the number of books he carried.</p>

<p>Then there was the freckled-faced small boy
in number three whose antics kept his mother in
a continual state of "nerves." Once when he
bounced one of those implements commonly
known as "spit balls" off of the bookish little
man's bald head, the girls thought they would die
trying to stifle their merriment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was the very pretty, but much be-powdered
and rouged girl behind them in number
nine. Grace embarrassed Betty very much by
turning around to look at her every five minutes
or so.</p>

<p>"She's a moving picture actress or something,
I'm sure of it," Grace confided in Betty's unsympathetic
ear. "I wonder if I could fix my hair
the way she does. She fascinates me."</p>

<p>"She seems to," Betty retorted dryly, adding
with a twinkle. "You may be able to fix your
hair like hers&mdash;though I doubt it&mdash;but please
remember that your mother doesn't want you
to use rouge."</p>

<p>"Well, you know I wouldn't do that," said
Grace in a huff, adding maliciously, "I guess you
are just jealous, that's all."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh, that must be it," said Betty, with
an unruffled good-nature that made Grace secretly
ashamed of herself.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Betty," she said after a rather
long pause, adding generously: "You don't need
to be jealous of anybody."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Betty answered, with a smile. "I
knew you didn't mean it, dear."</p>

<p>And so the long hours of the afternoon wore
away, dusk came, shrouding the swiftly moving
landscape in a veil of mystery. So engrossed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
were the girls in contemplation of the changing
beauty of nature that it seemed almost sacrilege
when the blatant lights of the train flashed forth,
bringing them violently back to a realization of
time and place.</p>

<p>"Don't you want any supper?" Mr. Nelson
was asking, in his pleasant voice. "It isn't like
the Outdoor Girls to overlook meal time."</p>

<p>"Far be it from us to spoil our good reputation,"
cried Mollie buoyantly, and away they
rushed to the dressing room to wash for supper.
Though dining on a train was no novelty to the
girls, they never lost the keenness of their first
delight in the experience.</p>

<p>"It's fascinating," Mollie remarked once, spearing
desperately at an elusive potato as the train
jerked and jolted over the rails at sixty miles
an hour, "to see how often you can raise your
coffee cup without spilling the coffee all over
your food!"</p>

<p>On this night at supper Mollie was so screamingly
funny that the girls had all they could do
to keep their hilarity from making them conspicuous.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Nelson at a table for two across
the aisle smiled indulgently at their charges, and
once Mrs. Nelson met her husband's glance and
chuckled fondly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty nice set of girls?" she said softly.</p>

<p>"Pretty nice!" Mr. Nelson agreed.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to wish we were at Gold Run
now," confided Mollie, after dining. She and
Amy had slipped into the seat opposite Betty and
Grace.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think it's all fun," cried Betty, for she
was always the last of the Outdoor Girls to feel
tired. "We change at Chicago to-morrow afternoon,"
she added. "And then two more nights
on the train, and then Gold Run!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that sounds good," cried Mollie, adding
eagerly: "Tell me, Betty, shall we be able to
choose any horse we want for our own particular
mount?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Betty, adding with a smile:
"It will be interesting to see the kind of horse
each one of you will choose. Amy will like the
gentle one, Grace will choose hers for its looks
and yours will be the most vicious one in the
pack, Mollie."</p>

<p>"Well, I like that!" said Mollie unperturbed.
"She wants to kill me off even before I get there."</p>

<p>"Pack?" murmured Amy. "Is a 'pack' of
horses right?" But no one answered her.</p>

<p>"I wonder," mused Grace dreamily, "if there
will be a tan one&mdash;all tan, you know, without
even a spot of any other color&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, of course," laughed Betty. "If we
haven't an all tan one in the corrals at Gold
Run, we'll send to the nearest ranch and have
one imported for you. Don't worry your little
head about that."</p>

<p>A little while after that they stopped at a
water station, and most of the passengers got off
to stretch their cramped limbs. And, as the conductor
informed them that they would be there
for fifteen minutes at least, the girls followed
the general example.</p>

<p>However, in their enthusiasm at finding the
good old solid earth under their feet once more,
they wandered too far, and the warning toot of
the starting train found them quite a distance
from the platform.</p>

<p>They had not earned the title of Outdoor Girls
for nothing, however, and by sprinting for all
they were worth they were able to make the last
car just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>"Whew, that was a close call," said Betty as
they made their way, panting, through to their
own car, where Mr. and Mrs. Nelson were looking
frantically for them. "No more water stations
for us."</p>

<p>Darkness fell, and the porters moved about,
making up berths and answering the hundred and
one insistent calls of the passengers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls went to bed with no protest whatever
and were soon sleeping the sleep of healthy youth.
It was toward midnight that they were rather
rudely jerked out of this beautiful sleep by a sudden
and almost violent stopping of the train.</p>

<p>Betty, who was sleeping in a lower berth, she
and Grace having decided to take turns, sat up and
peered out of the grimed window into the gloom.
No station lights greeted her, as she expected
confidently they would. Nothing but inky, startling
blackness.</p>

<p>That she was not the only one roused was
proved by the subdued sound of voices raised in
sleepy protest.</p>

<p>"They ought to put that engineer in prison for
stopping like that," said a man's voice.</p>

<p>"Gee! I thought it was a wreck, sure," came
another surly voice.</p>

<p>At this moment a couple of legs dangled themselves
over the side of Betty's berth and in another
minute the owner of them slid down beside
Betty. Betty giggled nervously, but Grace
clutched her arm and shook it.</p>

<p>"Listen!" she said. "There's nothing to laugh
about. This is a hold-up, that's what it is! You
know what your father said about there being a
lot of them around this place."</p>

<p>That this conclusion had been reached by some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
one else in the car was proved by a woman's voice
that rose shrilly above the rest.</p>

<p>"It's a hold-up, that's what it is!" she cried,
adding, with what seemed to Betty ridiculous
panic: "Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Better stop making a fuss, first off," growled
another masculine voice, and again Betty giggled
nervously.</p>

<p>"Goodness, I hope I don't have to get out in
my nightie," she said, and poked her head out
through the curtains.</p>

<p>"Look out," warned Grace, pulling her back.
"You may get shot or something."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," retorted Betty, not altogether
decided whether to be frightened or amused by
the situation. "There isn't anything out there but
a lot of funny looking heads sticking through
the curtains."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can laugh about it," said
Grace, through chattering teeth. "I don't think
it would be any j-joke to have all our m-money
taken from us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh-h&mdash;be quiet," warned Betty, peeping again
through the slit in the curtain. "Somebody's
coming. Listen!"</p>

<p>Grace listened, and so, evidently, did every one
else in the car. No wonder that, scared though
she undoubtedly was, Betty found humor in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
situation. Heads of every kind and description
stuck through the curtains, women's, some in
boudoir caps, some without, men's heads, either
bald or with hair grotesquely ruffled by sleep, and
on every face depicted every one of the varied
emotions which have disturbed the human race
since time began. And there they were, all frozen
to immobility by the sound of two men's voices
raised in heated discussion.</p>

<p>Then the owners of the voices came into view,
and the expression on all the faces changed to
bewildered amazement. Instead of the masked
bandit which they had half expected to see there
was a very portly and very excited gentleman and
with him was a conductor, not so portly but just
as excited.</p>

<p>"I tell you," the conductor was saying, his
face red with wrath, "you are violating the rules
of the company by flagging this train for a personal
matter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have told me that before," roared the
portly gentleman, waxing almost apoplectic.
"And I've told you I don't care a hang for the
rules of the company. What I want to find is my
daughter and that young scamp she ran away
with. And if you don't help me, I'll wring your
neck!"</p>

<p>"I tell you there is no couple answering your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
description on this train," rasped the conductor,
as the two made their way, shouting and gesticulating,
through the two rows of amazed heads and
so on into the next car.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be blowed," commented the voice belonging
to one of the heads; and as if that were
a signal, all the other heads promptly withdrew
to the accompaniment of exclamations and
laughter.</p>

<p>In the darkness of the berth Betty chuckled.</p>

<p>"Oh, they did look so funny, Gracie," she said.
"All those people with their heads stuck out into
the aisle. You should have taken a peek."</p>

<p>"Humph," grunted Grace, unsympathetically,
as she prepared to climb into her berth again.
Then she said: "I hope if that man's daughter
takes a notion to run away again, she won't do it
on our train, that's all!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE HANDSOME COWBOY</h3>


<p>Next morning the girls were hilarious over the
mirthful episode in the train the night before.
Betty and Mollie "took off" the expressions on
the faces of their fellow passengers till Amy and
Grace shouted with glee.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop it, you two," gasped Grace, finally.
"I'm sore from laughing. I think you would
make a hit as clowns in a circus."</p>

<p>"My, isn't she complimentary?" lisped Mollie,
and the girls went off in fresh gales of merriment.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Grace, after a pause, "that we
were going to reach Gold Run this afternoon, instead
of Chicago. I'm half afraid to spend another
night in the sleeper after the scare we got
last night. It might be a <i>real</i> bandit this
time."</p>

<p>"Oh, what would we care?" said Betty carelessly.
"I'd rather like to meet a train robber,
myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"About all a bandit could do would be to take
our money," added Mollie.</p>

<p>"All!" cried Grace indignantly. "Yes, that's
all. And what would we do without any money,
I'd like to know!"</p>

<p>"Goodness, we could always sell the ranch,"
said Betty, so matter-of-factly that the girls
chuckled. "We have Peter Levine to fall back
on, you know."</p>

<p>"'Peter Levine,'" repeated Amy, then added
quickly: "Oh yes, he was the man who wanted
your mother to sell the ranch."</p>

<p>"Yes, and it was too bad of you to keep him
all to yourself, Betty," said Grace reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You might at least have shown him to the
rest of us."</p>

<p>"He wasn't anything to show," said Betty, experiencing
again the feeling of distaste she had
had for the man. "He was one of the most unpleasant
looking men I ever saw. Just the same,"
she added lightly, "we owe him a lot. If it
hadn't been for him we probably wouldn't be sitting
in this beautiful train, speeding to our great
adventure. I told Allen I could almost love Peter
Levine for it."</p>

<p>"You did?" queried Mollie, her eyes dancing.
"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He left me rather suddenly," said Betty, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a chuckle at the memory. "He said he was on
his way to kill Peter."</p>

<p>"Poor Allen," laughed Grace. "It must be
awful to be that way. When is he coming out to
Gold Run, Betty?"</p>

<p>"As soon as he finishes this case he is on now,"
answered Betty, flushing in spite of herself as she
thought of Allen. "There is really no great
hurry about it, you know. Dad has made up his
mind to take a regular vacation while he's about
it, and I imagine mother won't care if she never
gets home."</p>

<p>That afternoon they changed trains at Chicago,
bemoaning the fact that they had not time
to see something of the great city before they
traveled farther west. There was only half an
hour between trains and, as every one knows,
there can be little sightseeing done in that limited
space of time. As it was, for some reason they
could not ascertain, the outgoing train was over
an hour late in starting. If they had known this
fact in advance they might have managed to
spend their time more profitably than in cooling
their heels in the station waiting room.</p>

<p>As it was, it was a rather disgruntled set of
girls who boarded the train for Gold Run and
allowed Mr. Nelson and the porter to find their
seats for them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see why trains can't be on time,"
grumbled Mollie, as she peered at the rather distorted
image of herself in the narrow mirror
between the windows. "Here it is nearly seven
o'clock and I'm as hungry as a bear."</p>

<p>"Well," said Betty, cheerfully, "something tells
me they have a diner on this train. Come on,
girls, let's wash our hands and get something to
eat."</p>

<p>The girls hardly knew which they enjoyed the
most, their dinner or the novel scenery that
slipped past them so swiftly. It was their first
venture into this part of the world, and they
found the initiation fascinating.</p>

<p>"The trouble is," complained Amy, "it will be
dark before long and we'll have to miss all this,"
with an expressive sweep of her hand toward the
car window.</p>

<p>"It is too bad," said Betty, regretfully adding,
with a light laugh: "If we were only like the
princess in the story, the members of whose royal
house never slept, we would probably see more of
the scenery."</p>

<p>That night the girls proved that Grace was not
alone in her fondness for sleep. There being no
more interruptions in the shape of fuming gentlemen
on the trail of runaway daughters, they
slept soundly through the long hours while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
train plunged onward through the inky blackness
of the night. They did not stir until the sun,
shining on their faces, roused them to the realization
that another beautiful day had dawned.</p>

<p>That is, it was beautiful up to noon. Then it
clouded down, and they ate lunch while the rain
dashed furiously on the windows of the dining
car.</p>

<p>"I am thankful we are under cover," said
Betty.</p>

<p>"Fancy riding on the ranch in this rain," put
in Amy.</p>

<p>"No life in the saddle for me when it rains,"
broke in Grace.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the girls napped and
read. When the time came to get supper they
were glad to see that they had run away from
the storm and the sun was setting clearly.</p>

<p>"Funny, how sleepy one gets," drawled Grace,
about nine o'clock. "I'll not stay up late."</p>

<p>No one wanted to do that, and in less than an
hour all were sleeping soundly while the long
train rumbled along on its trip westward.</p>

<p>"And this is the day," breathed Mollie the next
noon, as they made their way from the dining
car through some half dozen other cars to their
own. "Betty, I feel as if I couldn't wait to see
your beautiful ranch."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder," said Grace as they dropped into
their seats once more, "if those cowboys are
really as good-looking as you say, Betty. I must
admit," she added, as she viewed the rather monotonous
landscape petulantly, "I haven't seen
anything that looks like a cowboy yet."</p>

<p>"Goodness, hear the child!" cried Betty airily.
"She hasn't been near a ranch, yet she expects to
see whole droves of cow-punchers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look," Mollie interrupted, grasping her arm.
They were slowing down at a station and there
were no less than three picturesque looking young
fellows loitering about the place. One was
astride an extremely nervous horse that shied as
the train puffed to a standstill and rose on his
hind legs as though trying his best to shake his
rider off. "There's a real show for you," Mollie
cried joyfully. "How does that look to you,
Gracie? True to life?"</p>

<p>"Um, that's better," admitted Grace, while the
girls craned their necks for a better view of the
horseman. "Now if they only have that sort of
thing at Gold Run&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have a chance to find out pretty
soon whether they do or not," broke in Betty, the
thrill of suppressed excitement in her voice.
"Dad says we ought to get there in an hour."</p>

<p>"An hour!" wailed Amy, as the train jolted on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
its way once more and the romantic group on
the station were lost to view. "And I thought
we were almost there!"</p>

<p>But the hour passed more quickly than the
girls had anticipated, for the view from the car
windows, becoming more and more interesting,
absorbed their attention. As a general rule the
country was flat, but now and then in the background
could be caught glimpses of heavily
wooded mountain ranges that would offer chances
for all sorts of adventures to the four eager
Outdoor Girls.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there are wild animals in those
woods," said Amy, her eyes widening at the
thought. "Real ones."</p>

<p>"You don't suppose they import stuffed ones,
do you?" asked Grace dryly.</p>

<p>"Of course there are wild animals&mdash;lots of
'em," said Betty, feeling more and more gloriously
excited as they neared their destination.
"Maybe we can borrow a gun or two from the
cow-punchers and have a shot at 'em&mdash;animals,
I mean, not cow-punchers," she explained, with
a giggle.</p>

<p>On top of these rather wild imaginings came
Mr. Nelson, telling them it was time to get their
things together, for they were within a few minutes
of Gold Run.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know how long it takes you girls to put a
hat on," he laughed. "So I think you had better
start right away."</p>

<p>Then&mdash;Gold Run! with the dash for the door
and Grace running back to rescue a half-empty
but still precious candy box and Mollie wanting
to know if Amy would please stop pressing her
suitcase in the middle of her back&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Someway, Mr. Nelson managed to get them
all safely to the station platform, whereupon he
breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Whew! that's the hardest job you ever gave
me, Rose," he remarked to his wife, with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>Here, as at most of the other stations, was a
handful of cowboys who had come to meet the
train. One of these, a handsome young fellow,
detached himself from the rest and approached
Mrs. Nelson, sweeping off his sombrero as he
did so.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Nelson, ma'am?" he asked in a soft
drawl that captivated the girls immediately.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson smiled assent and the young fellow
indicated a buckboard drawn up to the station.</p>

<p>"I brought the wagon," he said, with a grin
that showed a beautiful set of white teeth. "An'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
some saddle hosses, thinkin' you might like to
ride&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>However, the ladies decided on the buckboard,
which was driven by a shy-eyed, sandy-haired
young fellow who gave the girls one frightened
glance and looked swiftly away again, for all
the world, Mollie said afterwards, as if he expected
them to bite him.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson elected to ride horseback with
Andy Rawlinson, which was the name of the
good-looking cowboy.</p>

<p>As the driver chirruped to the horses and they
clattered over the bumpy road, Grace turned to
Betty with a smile.</p>

<p>"I have realized the ambition of a life time!"
she said dramatically. "I have seen one handsome
cowboy!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>AT THE RANCH</h3>


<p>To the girls, that jolting ride was like an adventure
straight from the Arabian Nights. The
fact that they were squeezed four in a seat which
was meant to accommodate only three, served to
dampen their enthusiasm not a trifle. Mrs. Nelson,
riding in front with the bashful driver,
vainly sought to engage him in conversation.
After repeated failures she settled down to enjoy
the ride in silence.</p>

<p>A dozen yards or so ahead of them Andy Rawlinson
and Mr. Nelson cantered up the dusty
road, their horses' hoofs making the dust fly
in a white cloud.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" sneezed Betty, extracting a small
handkerchief from her pocket and applying it to
her nose, "I do hope those two keep their distance.
We'll be simply choked with dust."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Grace, as she rubbed her
dust-filled eyes, "if they don't have any rain in
this part of the world."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course they do; only this happens to be
the dry season," said Mollie, instructively, from
the heights of her superior intelligence. At least,
that is what she called it.</p>

<p>"I'll say it's dry," grumbled Grace.</p>

<p>"Ooh, look," Amy interrupted ecstatically.
"Isn't that a cactus over there? Oh, I've wanted
all my life to see some real cacti. Now I know
we're in the West."</p>

<p>The girls were silent for a moment, gazing out
over the rolling plain&mdash;a plain studded with
stunted trees and sickly-looking bushes with here
and there a cactus plant for variety's sake&mdash;out
to the hazy mountains beyond, serene, calm, majestic,
jutting jaggedly into the dazzling blue of
a cloudless sky.</p>

<p>"The mountains!" murmured Betty, half to
herself. "How I love them. The plains are fascinating
in a cruelly romantic way, but somehow
the mountains make one think of hidden springs
rushing swiftly into noisy foolish little brooks,
of bird songs, and the smell of cool damp earth,
of the crackling of dry twigs under one's feet,
and the pungent woodsy smell of camp fires&mdash;but
there," she broke off confusedly, as she realized
the girls were regarding her with fond amusement.
"I didn't mean to wax so poetic."</p>

<p>"It's all right, honey," said Mollie, giving her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
hand a warm little squeeze. "You rave right
along. I know just how you feel, for I get that
way myself sometimes."</p>

<p>"There <i>is</i> something mighty wonderful about
the mountains," added Grace softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I love them, too," broke in Amy, adding
with such earnestness that the girls looked at her
wonderingly. "They are everything that Betty
has said. And yet when Betty spoke of the plains
as being cruel I couldn't help wondering if the
mountains weren't sometimes like that, too."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" they queried, with quick
interest.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," Amy continued slowly, "that
the mountains might not seem so kind to one
who was lost in them&mdash;without a gun perhaps. I
have heard Will say that a person who had no
knowledge of woodcraft would find it almost
impossible to recover his path, once he had lost
it. And," she added, with a shudder, her eyes
fixed steadily on the distant mountain range,
"there are wild animals in those forests."</p>

<p>"Of course there are," agreed Betty lightly, as
she saw how serious the girls' faces had become.
"Oodles of foxes and bears and raccoons and
things. Why, how would you expect to get pretty
furs when you wanted them if those things didn't
exist? Cheer up, Amy dear. We're a long way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from being lost in the woods without a gun!"</p>

<p>A minute later the girls lost interest in everything
but the immediate present. For, in the distance,
but distinctly visible, loomed a long low
ranch house which the silent driver beside Mrs.
Nelson deigned to admit was on Gold Run Ranch.</p>

<p>"You see it, girls?" cried the lady, turning a
beaming face to the girls. "You know, I feel
just like a little girl with a beautiful new toy."</p>

<p>"And we're awfully glad you've got the toy,
Mrs. Nelson," said Grace, fervently.</p>

<p>"Look," cried Mollie suddenly. "Your father
and that cowboy are turning off from the main
road. That must be where the ranch begins. Oh,
girls, oh, girls, I'm glad I came!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later their jolting buckboard
turned in after the two horsemen, and since the
new road proved to be nothing but two deep ruts
worn in the grass and as the ponies attached to
the buckboard showed considerable excitement at
coming near home, the girls found themselves
holding on to each other convulsively to keep
from being thrown out on the stubbly grass at
the side of the road.</p>

<p>"Whew, I'm glad that's over!" exclaimed Mollie,
as the driver drew in the rearing horses and
spoke to them soothingly. "Come on, girls," she
added, making ready to jump out. "I'm going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to remove myself from this buckboard before one
of those horses decides to sit in my lap."</p>

<p>The girls laughed and followed her with alacrity.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Betty, hugging Amy ecstatically,
simply because she happened to be the nearest
one to hug. "There are the horse corrals over
there! And, oh, girls! look at the cows, dozens
and dozens and dozens of 'em. Mother," she
cried, turning wide-eyed to the latter, "do all
those 'anymiles' really belong to you?"</p>

<p>"I presume they do, dear," said Mrs. Nelson,
her own face flushed with excitement. "I can't
quite take in the amazing truth of it yet."</p>

<p>They were standing beside the first of a long
line of low buildings that seemed little more than
glorified sheds and which the girls decided must
be the "bunk houses" for the ranch hands.</p>

<p>And while they were wondering if it would
be possible to slip over to the corrals for a closer
look at the horses, Mr. Nelson sauntered up to
them, with handsome Andy Rawlinson keeping
diffidently a little in the rear.</p>

<p>"It's nearly supper time," he informed them
smiling. "And Andy here," he indicated young
Rawlinson, who grinned an acknowledgment,
"says that everybody has supper sharp on the
minute of six. So what do you say if we go up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to the house and have a little refreshment?"</p>

<p>The girls were not altogether reluctant to obey,
much as they desired a closer look at the bronchos,
for they realized that they were pretty hungry.</p>

<p>The ranch house was one of those quaint old
structures which had begun as a tiny, one-story
frame cottage and had gradually been added to
until now it seemed, Betty said, to "spread all
over the landscape." It had porches and doors
in the most unexpected places, but the whole
house was painted such an immaculate white and
the shutters were such a friendly green that the
effect of the place was indescribably charming.</p>

<p>"If the house is as clean inside as it looks outside,"
whispered Grace to Betty as Andy Rawlinson
led them up on to one of the many porches,
"I'll never dare go in. I never felt so mussy and
dirty in all my life."</p>

<p>"Never mind, we're all in the same boat," said
Betty encouragingly, and then they stepped into
one of the pleasantest rooms they had ever seen.</p>

<p>It was big and cool and airy, in spite of the
fact that supper preparations were going on at
one end of it. Rough picturesque looking chairs
were scattered about, and over near the windows
a long table was invitingly set for six. And oh,
the delicious odor of cooking things that was
wafted on the air!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>At sight of them a stout but immaculately neat
and rosy-faced woman left whatever she was doing
with a frying pan on the stove and came over
to them, wiping her hands on her apron, her face
wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>"Go long with you, Andy Rawlinson," she
cried as the youth lingered rather awkwardly
in the doorway. "There's no need for you to
tell me who these folks are, for I already know
them for the new master and his lady and the
young ladies, bless their pretty sweet faces.
Come right in, all of you, and Lizzie here," turning
to a wholesome-looking, mouse-haired girl
who had come in from the other room, "Lizzie
will take you to see the rooms and you can have
your pick. But don't be long," she cautioned, as
they started to follow Lizzie and she turned back
to her frying pan on the stove, "for supper is all
ready and you must be nearly famished."</p>

<p>If the girls had been impressed by the quaintness
of this quaint old house from the outside,
they were even more delighted by its interior.</p>

<p>They passed down a rather dark and narrow
hall at the end of which were three low steps
leading to such a series of rooms as the girls had
never seen before, each furnished neatly but
plainly, the only touch of color being the gay
cretonne curtains at the windows. The rooms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
all seemed to be connected by doors and to reach
these doors one was obliged to go up two steps
or down three or up one, as the case might be.</p>

<p>"Goodness," cried Betty, when Lizzie had led
the way through three of these quaint little rooms
and the open doors seemed to reveal several others,
"I wonder if all these rooms were really
occupied."</p>

<p>"Yes, miss," said Lizzie, halting and speaking
unexpectedly. "They was a time when these
rooms wuz all filled. Old Mr. Barcolm"&mdash;this
being the name of Mrs. Nelson's great uncle&mdash;"had
a many children and grandchildren an'
seemed like he was sot on 'em all livin' with him.
But they got to quarrelin' and all left th' old
man an' he was so mad he cut 'em all out o' his
will. At least," she finished, as though warned
by the intent look of her listeners that she had
said more than she had intended to, "that's what
they says. But mebbe it ain't the truth, fer all
I knows."</p>

<p>Then she led them on again through the maze
of rooms while the girls thought amazedly of
what she had told them. Finally she came to a
stop in a room, larger than the rest, and turned
her rather stolid gaze upon Mr. and Mrs. Nelson.</p>

<p>"Miz Cummins," she announced, dully&mdash;the
girls were afterward to find out that Cummins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
was the name of the rosy-faced woman who had
met them so cordially at the door and who seemed
to be general housekeeper for the place&mdash;"Miz
Cummins thought as how this would be a good
room fer the mister and missus. They is some
nice rooms back of these fer the young ladies.
She sed, if you liked any of the other rooms better,
to take your pick. They's fresh water in the
pitchers," indicating a washstand with a bowl
and two pitchers of gleaming water upon it,
"an' if you want anythin' else, you wuz please to
tell me." And with these words, uttered so precisely
that it sounded like a rehearsed speech,
which, in fact, it was, Lizzie disappeared, leaving
the travelers to themselves.</p>

<p>"Come on, girls," cried Betty, pushing them
before her into the next room. "Let's see what
kind of rooms 'Miz Cummins' has picked out for
us."</p>

<p>They were not at all unusual rooms, being
both about the same size and nearly square and
furnished about as simply as they could possibly
be.</p>

<p>"If it weren't for the different colored cretonne
at the windows," said Mollie, with a chuckle,
"these rooms might be twins. You and Grace can
have the lavender cretonne, Amy, and Betty and
I will take the blue."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't those beds look heavenly?" sighed
Grace, as she pulled off her hat and threw herself
upon the big, snowy-sheeted bed.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" cried Amy, in dismay. "She's
flopped. Get her up, somebody, before she gets
the bed so dirty I can't sleep in it to-night."</p>

<p>For answer Betty made a dash for Grace,
pulled her to her feet, and pushed her over to
the washstand.</p>

<p>"See that water, Grace Ford?" she cried
sternly. "Now use it!"</p>

<p>"And make it snappy," added Mollie slangily,
as she and Betty disappeared into the adjoining
room. "I can smell 'Miz Cummins'' cooking
clear in here!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>A SUDDEN STORM</h3>


<p>The girls spent the rest of that day getting acquainted,
at which agreeable task Andy Rawlinson,
the head cowboy, assisted pleasantly. The
latter introduced them to several others of the
ranch hands, all of whom were as picturesque and
good-natured as Andy himself.</p>

<p>Escorted by Rawlinson and followed by the
admiring glances of the other cowboys, the girls
were introduced to the interior of the bunk houses
which, with their rude wooden cots built into the
side of the walls, their scanty and rather severe
furniture, and the romantic looking trophies fastened
to the bare boards of the walls, filled the girls
with curiosity and interest.</p>

<p>Then on to the corrals, where some spectacular
broncho busting was staged for the sole benefit of
the visitors. In this dangerous business Andy
himself took a part, and the girls gasped with dismay
and later with admiration as the boy ran
alongside a vicious looking animal for a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
paces, then flung himself recklessly upon the
beast's back and clung there, seemingly defying
all the laws of gravitation.</p>

<p>"Oh, he surely will be killed!" cried Amy,
clutching Betty in terror. "That horse will throw
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, can't you, Amy?" cried Mollie impatiently,
beside herself with excitement. "Don't
you suppose he has ever done this sort of thing
before?"</p>

<p>Then followed such an exhibition of sheer grit
and skill and dauntless courage as none of the
girls would ever forget.</p>

<p>The vicious brute raced madly around and
around the corrals, cruel head upflung, nostrils
dilated, but still the man upon his back clung with
maddening persistence. Then he stopped so suddenly
that the man was almost flung over his lowered
head and the girls held their breath, but
Andy recovered himself and touching the spurs
to the beast's belly, sent it flying round the corral
once more. There was sweat on its body and the
flaring nostrils were blood red with the effort, but
the spirit of the beast was still unbroken.</p>

<p>Around and around the ring he plunged, the
other horses galloping wildly from his path, then
suddenly as though the thing on his back had
maddened him past bearing, he began to buck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and to plunge and to rear himself on his hind
legs in a desperate effort to throw himself backward,
until it seemed to the fascinated, terrified
girls that Andy Rawlinson surely must be killed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 261px;">
<img src="images/p070.jpg" width="261" height="400" alt="HE CLUNG TO THE HORSE&#39;S BACK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN A PART OF HIM." title="HE CLUNG TO THE HORSE&#39;S BACK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN A PART OF HIM." />
<span class="caption">HE CLUNG TO THE HORSE&#39;S BACK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN A PART OF HIM.</span>
</div>

<div class='center'><i>The Outdoor Girls in the Saddle.</i> <i>Page 64</i></div>

<p>But Andy Rawlinson had not spent his twenty-eight
years in the saddle for nothing. He clung
to that horse's back as though he had been a part
of him, and when the outraged beast tried to
throw himself over backward for the second time,
Andy evidently decided that he had played
enough.</p>

<p>A cruel blow of his spurred heel brought the
beast almost to its knees with a whinny of pain.
Then it jumped high in the air, and once more
began its furious race with this mysterious and
horrible being that clung so tenaciously to his
back.</p>

<p>Andy rode him hard, cruelly hard, and when
the beast, panting, sweating, beaten, would have
stopped he dug the spurs in and drove him on,
on, until the broncho's breath came in sobbing
gasps and his legs trembled under him.</p>

<p>Betty, who could never bear to see anything
hurt, shouted to Andy Rawlinson as man and
beast came abreast of her:</p>

<p>"Isn't that enough?" she cried. "You've
beaten him. Stop! Please stop!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>And Andy Rawlinson, flashing his pleasant
smile, flung himself from his mount, while the
beautiful horse stood there, quivering, head hung
in shame&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Game hoss, that," said Andy, as he vaulted
the low railing and approached the girls.
"Fought like a thoroughbred."</p>

<p>"And you were wonderful," cried Betty, with
her warm impulsiveness. "I never saw finer riding.
We were all afraid you were going to be
killed."</p>

<p>Andy was pleased, but he looked at Betty rather
quizzically.</p>

<p>"Strange," he drawled, with a smile on his
face, "strange what impressions you get sometimes.
Now I kind o' thought you was mad at
me, the way you called out to stop. Anyways,
you looked mad."</p>

<p>"I was only sorry for the horse," Betty explained
gravely. "He was game, as you say, and
I hated to see his spirit entirely broken."</p>

<p>Andy Rawlinson looked at her with admiring
approval in his nice eyes.</p>

<p>"There speaks the real lover of animals," he
cried enthusiastically. "I hate to break a good
hoss myself, but you see it has to be done&mdash;for
the sake of the hoss. A hoss that's a bad actor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is mighty like a mad dog. It has to be killed&mdash;or
broke. So we break 'em. But now," he said,
glancing toward the corrals, "I reckon you young
ladies would like to pick out some nice gentle
hosses to ride while you're here."</p>

<p>The girls nodded and crowded forward eagerly
while Andy called to some of the cowboys
who had been lingering enviously near.</p>

<p>"Bring out the sorrel and Nigger, will you,
Jake?" he said to one of them. "I'll corral Lady
and Nabob."</p>

<p>The girls watched with interest while the boys
corraled the four horses Andy had selected and
led them forth for the visitors' inspection.</p>

<p>They were splendid specimens of horse flesh,
and for a moment the girls were simply lost in
admiration. Nigger, as his name implied, was a
magnificent coal-black animal without a speck of
white upon him anywhere. He and Betty seemed
to form a mutual admiration society on the instant,
for with a gentle whinny he cantered up to
the girl and began nosing inquisitively in her
pocket in search of sugar. Luckily Betty had
brought some with her, and she fed a couple of
lumps to the beautiful animal, thereby definitely
sealing their pact of friendship.</p>

<p>"Oh you, Nigger!" crooned Betty joyfully, as
she rubbed the velvet muzzle. "You and I are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
going to be great little pals, aren't we? You perfect
old darling!" And Nigger whinnied again
and nosed about for more sugar.</p>

<p>"Well, I like that," cried Grace, breaking the
silence in which they had all been enjoyably regarding
the little scene. "Betty doesn't have to
choose her horse&mdash;it chooses her."</p>

<p>"Oh well, Betty always did have a way with
her," laughed Mollie, and promptly turned her
attention to the remaining three horses.</p>

<p>"Lady" was a lovely white filly with whom
Amy fell in love immediately.</p>

<p>"This one's mine," she cried, putting a possessive
hand on Lady's flank while the latter
turned her dainty head and regarded the girl out
of softly-wistful brown eyes. "I wanted her as
soon as I saw her."</p>

<p>Her claim was not disputed, for Grace was
raving over the horse called Nabob, who was, by
a strange coincidence, that very light tan color
which she most adored.</p>

<p>"How did you know I always wanted a horse
just like this?" she cried, turning joyfully to
Andy Rawlinson who, with the other "boys" had
been looking on amusedly.</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Andy, with a grin, "seems like
you are all suited pretty well."</p>

<p>For Mollie, whose adventurous spirit craved a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
spice of the dangerous in everything, had taken
immediately to the sorrel, who had apparently
been given no name. He was a skittish horse,
gentle, as Andy explained, but "pow'ful nervous&mdash;had
to be sort o' coaxed along."</p>

<p>"You're my horse, all right," Mollie declared,
stroking the animal's muzzle fearlessly, unmindful
of rolling eyes and nervously twitching ears.
"I don't like 'em too tame, old boy. And by the
way," she added, struck by a sudden inspiration,
"I've thought of just the name for you. I'm
going to call you 'Old Nick.'"</p>

<p>And so, when the selection had been made, to
everybody's satisfaction, nothing would do but
the girls must try their mounts that very evening.
They had brought their riding tags in preparation
for their summer in the saddle, and when they
had slipped into the tight breeches, and leather
leggings, tailored coat, and snug fitting hat,
they looked like what they were&mdash;four thoroughly
modern and very pretty Outdoor Girls.</p>

<p>Later, when they rode proudly about the
ranch on their splendid mounts, the ranch hands
were lost in admiration of them.</p>

<p>"Gosh," said one, removing his hat and fanning
himself with it, for the evening was warm,
"when Andy said they was four girls comin' from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the city to visit us I was plumb skeered. But
these here girls, they ain't no ordinary kind, no
siree. An' they sho' does know how to ride."</p>

<p>However, the girls were satisfied with a rather
short ride that evening for they were out of practice
and they knew that sore muscles would be
the price of over-exertion.</p>

<p>In the days that followed they took longer and
longer rides, even venturing along the rough forest
trails when Andy Rawlinson was with them
as guide and protector. Mr. and Mrs. Nelson
rode, too, but, not being as strenuous as the girls,
they were glad to have any one as capable as
Andy Rawlinson to look out for their charges.</p>

<p>But one day, much as they liked him, the girls
got a little tired of Andy's chaperonage, and at
Mollie's suggestion they decided to "give him
the slip."</p>

<p>"Anybody would think he was our granny, the
way he dictates to us," she complained, as she
flicked a fly from Old Nick's side, thereby causing
him to shy wildly. "We know our way about
all right now, and I'm sure we Outdoor Girls
never needed anybody to look out for us, anyway."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear," laughed Betty, half way between
conviction and protest. "I don't like to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Andy around all the time, any more than you
do, Mollie, but I'm not sure that we know our
way about as well as we might. If we should get
lost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be an old wet blanket," cried Mollie
impatiently, and as Amy and Grace seemed for
once to be of her mind, Betty had nothing to do
but to surrender as gracefully as she could.</p>

<p>It was after lunch that the girls managed to
slip away without being observed to where their
mounts were tethered at the edge of the woodland.
And oh, what a glorious sense of freedom
when they were mounted and cantering down a
cool forest trail&mdash;alone!</p>

<p>They had been this way with Andy before, so
they had no fear of losing their path and they
urged their horses to more and more speed, intoxicated
by the sense of freedom.</p>

<p>What they did not notice was that the sun had
disappeared behind an ominous bank of clouds
and the wind was rising threateningly. And so
they were caught fairly and squarely by the deluge
that swept upon them with a bewildering
suddenness.</p>

<p>Where to go? Where to turn for shelter from
the driving rain and moaning wind? They
checked their horses while they gazed at each
other wildly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Betty's straining eyes made out what
seemed to be the outline of a little shed or cabin,
half hidden by surrounding foliage.</p>

<p>"There's a house over there," she cried, hastily
dismounting and tying Nigger to a tree a little
off the path. "Maybe whoever lives there will
let us in till the rain stops."</p>

<p>The girls followed her example and hurriedly
made their way on foot toward their one hope
of refuge. When they reached the house Betty
started to knock, then paused uncertainly, her
hand uplifted. For above the beat of the rain
and the shrill whine of the wind came a strain of
music, mournful, yet exquisitely beautiful.
Amazed, forgetful of their discomfort, the girls
listened while the throbbing, haunting melody
wailed itself to a close.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I've heard that music before," Betty murmured,
then rapped gently, almost timidly, on the
door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>ALONG THE TRAIL</h3>


<p>Betty's knock had to be repeated twice before
the occupant of the cabin responded.</p>

<p>"Knock harder, Betty, if&mdash;&mdash;" Mollie was
beginning when the door opened at last and a
very strange person stood upon the threshold.
Tall, with stooped shoulders and a head bent a
little as though he had spent countless hours over
his violin, with long, curly hair, and with the
visioned eyes of the musician, the man was a
figure that would have made people turn to stare
at him anywhere.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;we&mdash;we are very sorry to trouble you,"
said Betty hesitatingly, as the musician made
no effort to break the silence. "But it is raining
hard, as you see, and we thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man started and frowned.</p>

<p>"Ah yes, of course," he said, moving aside and
motioning them into the room. "You will find
shelter here, but very little else, I fear."</p>

<p>As the girls entered rather hesitantly the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
turned from them abruptly and, lifting the violin
that lay upon the rough board table, he began
with the utmost gentleness to put it in its case.
The girls had the rather uncomfortable impression
that the man was forcing himself to be polite
to them&mdash;that if he had been any other than
a gentleman he would have refused them admittance.</p>

<p>They looked uneasily at each other and then
toward the one window in the room, and one
thought was in the minds of all of them&mdash;to escape
from the enforced hospitality of this man.</p>

<p>"I think the rain is letting up a little," said
Grace softly.</p>

<p>"I reckon we won't have to stay more than a
few minutes," agreed Betty, then, as their long-haired
host put down his case and turned toward
them, she ventured a shy compliment.</p>

<p>"We heard you playing as we came along," she
said. "It was very wonderful."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the man gruffly, and turned
away so abruptly that Betty felt as if some one
had struck her.</p>

<p>Mollie looked indignant and Amy put an arm
about Betty as she whispered:</p>

<p>"The rain has nearly stopped, honey. Don't
you think we had better go?"</p>

<p>So, with half-hearted expressions of thanks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
from the girls and no expression of regret at all
from the man, the new acquaintances parted, the
girls hurrying down the dripping path to where
their horses were tethered.</p>

<p>Once Mollie looked back toward the cabin, and
her indignation burst forth.</p>

<p>"Look, he could hardly wait for us to get outside
to shut the door," she said. "Of all the ill-mannered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think he meant to be ill-mannered,"
interposed Betty mildly, as she reached
Nigger and he whinnied a welcome. "He was
just distantly polite, that's all. He didn't want
to be bothered, probably, and he had a hard time
to keep from showing it."</p>

<p>"Huh," grunted Mollie, as she flung herself
upon Old Nick's back and patted him soothingly.
"I'm sure he has some real reason for not wanting
folks around. He acted mighty funny to
me," she said.</p>

<p>"Goodness, hear the child!" cried Grace, as
they rode swiftly back the way they had come
through the fine drizzle. "She never can resist
making a thief or something out of a perfectly
ordinary person."</p>

<p>"Seems to me he is anything but ordinary," interposed
Amy thoughtfully. "No ordinary person
could play the violin the way he was playing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
it when we came up to the house. That sounded
like the work of a master."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Betty, a faraway look in her
eyes. "He plays exquisitely, if he does live in a
little house away up in the woods. And I can't
shake off the impression that I have heard that
same selection played in just that same way somewhere
before."</p>

<p>Though this first excursion had been somewhat
of a failure, the girls were by no means discouraged
and in the days that followed they rode
almost constantly. Finally they began to know
their way about like the natives.</p>

<p>Their rides were taken mostly in the open
country, however, for in the woods they knew
lurked very real dangers. But these they avoided
more to save Mrs. Nelson worry than from any
personal fears.</p>

<p>But one day, feeling more than usually adventurous
and growing more and more confident of
their ability to find their way around alone, they
dared venture along a rocky trail that offered
wonderful romantic opportunities.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is the life!" cried Grace, as Nabob
stepped daintily over the rocks and underbrush
that almost completely overgrew the narrow path.
"A peach of a horse under you, the whole day
before you, and nothing to do but enjoy your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>self.
Whoa-up there, Nabob. What's the matter
with you?" for the horse had whinnied softly
and shied almost imperceptibly to the side of the
trail.</p>

<p>At the same time the other horses seemed to
catch some of Nabob's uneasiness, and the girls
were kept busy for the next few minutes soothing
them and coaxing them back into a normal mode
of progress.</p>

<p>"Something scared them," said Amy nervously.
"Don't you think we had better go back, girls?
This trail seems to be getting narrower and narrower.
I don't believe anybody comes along here
very often."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" cried Mollie sharply.
"That's what we are here for, isn't it? If we
wanted people, we could have plenty of them
right back on the ranch."</p>

<p>"Stop quarreling, girls," said Betty, matter-of-factly.
"We'll eat pretty soon and that will
make everybody feel better." Kindly Mrs.
Cummins had put up an appetizing lunch for the
girls.</p>

<p>"Look!" she cried a moment later, as the trail
broadened out and they reached a rather open
space in the woods through which they could look
straight down&mdash;for they were on a considerable
elevation&mdash;into the thriving little mining town of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Gold Run. "I didn't know you could see Gold
Run from here."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it look funny and tiny?" cried Mollie,
reining in beside her. "It must be an awfully
long way off."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't this be a good place to eat?" queried
Amy hopefully, and the girls laughed at her.</p>

<p>"We aren't hungry enough yet," said Betty, as
she turned her horse to continue down the trail.</p>

<p>They rode on, following the trail as it wound
deeper and deeper into the woodland, catching
glimpses now and then of the mining camp down
in the hollow.</p>

<p>It seemed as if they were really getting closer
to Gold Run and, fascinated by the new game
they were playing, forgetting their fears in the
new sights and sounds all about them, the girls
rode farther and farther into the heart of a forest,
whose smiling face often served to hide some
hideous danger.</p>

<p>But to the girls all was beauty and sunshine
and they conversed merrily as they cantered
along.</p>

<p>"When is Allen coming, Betty?" asked Grace.
"I had an idea he would be here before this."</p>

<p>"Why, dad has written, asking him to come
as soon as he can," answered Betty, striving to
look unconscious. "You know what that girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Lizzie said about mother's relatives&mdash;she never
knew she had them till she came here&mdash;and dad
thinks some of these people may make up their
minds to contest the will. They haven't made
trouble yet&mdash;but you never can tell. Listen,
girls," she added suddenly. "Will you promise
not to breathe a word of it if I tell you a big
secret?"</p>

<p>"Hope to die," they chorused piously.</p>

<p>"Well, our old friend Peter Levine has been
around pestering mother again."</p>

<p>At this news, Grace, who was riding ahead,
checked her mount so suddenly that Betty had
all she could do to keep Nigger from swallowing
Nabob's tail.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, put out your hand when
you do that next time," laughed Betty.</p>

<p>"Well," said Grace as she gave Nabob a gentle
slap that started him on again, "Peter Levine
must want that ranch very badly, to be following
us all over the continent this way."</p>

<p>"He seems to be rather anxious," said Betty
dryly. "He has offered mother twenty thousand
for it this time."</p>

<p>"Going up," cried Mollie, with a chuckle. "If
your mother holds on much longer, Betty, she
will be a millionaire."</p>

<p>"Well, mother is more certain than ever that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
there is something unusual about Gold Run
Ranch," went on Betty, as she urged Nigger up
a gentle slope. "She confidently expects to discover
a gold mine, and so that's another reason
why she thinks Allen ought to be here."</p>

<p>"Goodness, let's all get out and dig," cried Mollie.</p>

<p>"Can we have all we find, Betty?" called Amy,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Every last gold brick," answered Betty happily,
and then they came upon another open space,
and there, lying not more than half a mile below
them, was the mining town of Gold Run.</p>

<p>"Now here's the place to have some lunch," said
Betty, slipping to the ground and leading Nigger
off a little way into the woods where she tethered
him securely. "We can look right down into the
town and eat our lunch at the same time."</p>

<p>The girls followed suit, and it did not take
them long afterward to discover that they were
very hungry. So out came the lunch basket, and
never did biscuits and cheese and fried chicken
taste more delicious than they did to the girls
right there in that romantic little spot in the
woods.</p>

<p>"I hope it doesn't rain the way it did the other
day," said Mollie, as she lazily surveyed a cloudless
sky.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"We haven't even a cabin in the woods to go
to this time," said Grace, adding, as the thought
brought up a picture of the long-haired musician
who had been so painfully polite: "I wonder
what our friend, Long Hair, lives on, anyway.
Maybe he goes out and kills bears and things.
They say bear meat is very good eating," she
added reflectively.</p>

<p>"Maybe we can catch one ourselves and take
it home for dinner," suggested Mollie, and the
girls looked as if they did not like her suggestion
at all.</p>

<p>"Methinks the bear would be more likely to
catch us," Betty was saying when a chorus of low
whinnyings and stampings coming from where
the horses were tethered caused them to jump to
their feet in alarm. Suddenly the nervousness
of the animals changed to panic and they began
to rear and plunge, straining madly at the tethering
straps, snorting and screaming with terror.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Mollie, her voice shrilling above
the noise. "There! In the woods! Oh, run for
your lives, girls! Run!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>DANGER AHEAD</h3>


<p>Coming toward the girls through the trees,
crouched low, sinister eyes fixed upon them, were
two great timber wolves. The girls, terrified as
they were, saw at a glance that it would be of
no use to run, the movement would only infuriate
the beasts and precipitate their attack.</p>

<p>"The trees!" gasped Betty, feeling herself in
the grip of the deadly inertia that one experiences
sometimes in a nightmare. "Make for the trees,
girls; they are our only chance."</p>

<p>Luckily, the branches of the trees swung low
to the ground, or the girls could never have saved
themselves. As it was, they had barely time
to swing themselves free of the ground when the
great beasts darted into the open, fangs bared,
snarling hideously. Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Two sharp reports from the
direction of the woodland and one of the wolves
sprang clear of the ground, then slunk into the
underbrush, while the other staggered, fell, strug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>gled
to its feet, fell again, and after one convulsive
movement, lay still.</p>

<p>While the girls stared, unable to follow this
swift turn of events, there was the sound of
running feet coming in their direction and the
next moment two figures broke through into the
cleared space.</p>

<p>One was a little wizened man who seemed, for
all his apparent age, extremely agile. The other
was a girl, a splendid, big creature, who stood
as tall as the man, and who, like him, carried a
rifle.</p>

<p>The two ran to the fallen animal, talking excitedly,
and turned it over to be sure it was dead.
They were so absorbed that they did not notice
the girls, who dropped down quietly from their
perches in the trees. The sight of the guns carried
by the newcomers had had a tremendously
reassuring effect upon them. The wonderful
sensation of relief that swept over them as they
realized their almost miraculous escape, was so
keen as to be almost pain.</p>

<p>Still, they were not quite free from fear as
they approached the prostrate body of the big
beast, over which their rescuers were still bending.
It was the girl who first discovered them.</p>

<p>"Hello!" she cried, straightening up and turning
upon the girls a frank regard. "You was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the ones this old boy was after, eh? Look, Dad,"
she added, pointing to where the four horses were
still bucking and snorting in fright. "There's
the hosses we heard, but I reckon 'twas these gals
the wolves was after."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," said Betty, trying to
smile through a shiver. "It wasn't very much
fun while it lasted, either."</p>

<p>At this the old man, who had very kindly, keen
blue eyes in his seamed and wrinkled face, turned
and spat upon the ground meditatively.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me," he said, looking
from one to the other of the girls, "that you
purty young girls was out hyar all alone, without
even a gun to protect yourselves with?"</p>

<p>"I guess we were." It was Mollie who spoke
this time, and her tone was rueful. "We aren't
used to this part of the world, you see, and so
we didn't know what a risky thing we were
doing."</p>

<p>"They are most as bad as the Hermit of Gold
Run, aren't they, Dad?" asked the big girl, her
eyes twinkling. "He goes about everywhere
through the woods without a gun and only his
violin for company; and, somehow or other, the
beasts never molest him. Some says he charms
'em with his violin, but I think it's just luck,"
she added, with a wise shake of her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls, whose curiosity had revived as their
fears subsided, listened with interest to this
rather long speech of the mountain girl.</p>

<p>"Has this&mdash;er&mdash;hermit, as you call him&mdash;&mdash;"
Betty interrogated eagerly, "has he long curly
hair and is he tall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With stooped shoulders?" finished Amy.</p>

<p>The mountain girl looked amazed.</p>

<p>"Why yes. Do you know him?" she asked,
adding, as though to explain her surprise: "He
doesn't like to see people, you know, and folks
round here don't know much about him 'cept that
he plays the violin. That's why they calls him
the hermit, 'cause he lives alone an' hates everybody."</p>

<p>"All except Meggy, here," interposed the old
man, a look of pride in his eyes as he gazed at
his daughter. "He likes her fust rate. She says
it's 'cause she takes him grub an' good things to
eat. But I know better."</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Dad," cried the girl, flushing with
embarrassment. "It's jest one of your idees that
people like me better'n most when they don't at
all." As though to change the subject, she
touched the stiff animal at her feet with the toe of
her stout boot.</p>

<p>"What you aim to do with this one, Dad?"
she asked. "It was your bullet got him. Mine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
went wild, an' I jest injured the other feller."</p>

<p>"Waal," said the old man, his gaze fixed speculatively
on the big beast, "he's not wuth the
trouble o' skinning an' his meat ain't much good,
so I reckon we'd better leave him, daughter.
Time I was gettin' back to the mine."</p>

<p>He turned to go, but Betty was before him,
hand outstretched impulsively.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must let us thank you," she
cried. "If you and your daughter hadn't happened
along just then I don't know what we
should have done."</p>

<p>"Oh, thet's all right, thet's all right," said the
old miner, too embarrassed to meet her eye.
"Glad we could be some use to you, ma'am. But
ef you'll take an old man's advice," he added, as
he and his daughter started through the woods
in the direction of Gold Run, "you won't go
roaming around in these parts without a gun
onto you. 'Tain't safe, noways."</p>

<p>"We won't," they promised.</p>

<p>Once their protectors were gone they were wild
with impatience to get out of this place of dangers.
Their fingers trembled as they untied the
horses, and it was as much as they could do to
get the animals to stand still long enough to
mount them.</p>

<p>However, once in the saddle, they galloped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
along that narrow trail at full speed, regardless
of rocks and old stumps of trees and treacherous
holes, their one thought to reach the open road&mdash;and
safety.</p>

<p>When at last the plain stretched before them,
level and red hot in the blazing afternoon sun,
they all uttered a silent prayer of thankfulness.</p>

<p>"You were right, Amy," said Betty suddenly,
as Amy came up abreast of her, "when you said
the mountains could be cruel too."</p>

<p>"We'll not ever dare tell the folks," said Grace,
shuddering at the memory of their close escape.
"They would never let us out of their sight
again."</p>

<p>"It was mighty lucky for us that Meggy and
her father happened along just as they did," said
Mollie. "I know I couldn't have held on very
long where I was, and once on the ground I'd
have made a lovely tender morsel for the little
wolves."</p>

<p>"You flatter yourself," retorted Grace, and
Amy shivered.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you girls can joke about
such a thing," she said. "I was about frightened
to death."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think the rest of us enjoyed it,"
said Mollie, and at this point Betty thought it
was about time to interfere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wasn't it odd&mdash;Meggy's speaking of our
friend the musician and calling him the Hermit
of Gold Run?" she said. "I'm glad the poor
lonely fellow has a nice girl like Meggy to befriend
him."</p>

<p>"Huh, he didn't seem to want befriending very
much when we saw him," said Mollie. "We
couldn't have been frozen more completely if we
had dropped on an iceberg."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, he has 'ze temperament,'" said
Grace, with an elaborate gesture.</p>

<p>"Seems kind of strange, his living up there all
alone," said Amy thoughtfully. "You would
think any one who could play the way he can
would hate to bury himself in the wilderness.
Unless&mdash;&mdash;" she paused, and Mollie jumped joyfully
into the opening.</p>

<p>"Unless there is some reason why he has to,"
said the latter, adding with an I-told-you-so air,
"I thought there was some mystery about that
man, and now you are beginning to think so
yourselves. You just keep your eyes open and
watch for a surprise!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE LANDSLIDE</h3>


<p>After their perilous adventure, the Outdoor
Girls shunned the forest unless they were accompanied
by one or more of the cowboys at the
ranch. Andy Rawlinson escorted them whenever
he could, but his duties as foreman of the
ranch kept him very busy and he sometimes appointed
one of the ranch hands to take his place.</p>

<p>However, these excursions became less and less
frequent as the girls became more interested in
the booming mining town of Gold Run.</p>

<p>This they had visited with Mr. and Mrs. Nelson
and Andy, and the whole thing made them
feel more than ever as if they were living some
motion picture drama.</p>

<p>There was the regulation general store and the
inevitable dance hall where the lucky miners came
to spend their golden nuggets and the unlucky
tried to drown their misery in the companionship
of others.</p>

<p>Their eyes wide with interest and pleasure and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
their tongues busy with questions, the girls cantered
down the narrow, crooked wagon road
called "Main Street." They read the names over
the doors of the dingy little shops, commenting
gayly upon their queerness.</p>

<p>"Peter Levine, Attorney," read Betty aloud
from a sign just a little dingier than the rest.
Then she drew rein and waited for her mother,
who was riding more slowly with Mr. Nelson.
The other girls, who had ridden on ahead, suddenly
missed her, saw that she had stopped, and
came back curiously.</p>

<p>"Look, Mother," Betty was saying as they
came up. "This is where dear Peter Levine hails
from. His checked suit and loud tie must look
funny in that dingy little shop," she added, with
a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Well, let's ride along," suggested Mrs. Nelson
nervously. "He might see us and take it into
his head to come out. And I don't want to have
anything more to do with him until Allen comes."</p>

<p>"Allen," thought Betty, as they turned and
cantered on again. "I wish he would hurry a
little. He seems an awfully long time coming."</p>

<p>After they had seen all that there was to see
of the town itself, Andy led them to some of the
important mines on the outskirts. They listened
with lively interest while the young fellow ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>plained
to them how the ore was extracted from
the mountain side where it had lain unmolested
for thousands of years.</p>

<p>"It almost seems a shame to disturb it," said
Amy at this point, and the girls laughed at her.</p>

<p>"Just give me a chance at it, that's all," said
Mollie longingly.</p>

<p>At one of these mines they met the old man
and his daughter, Meggy, whose timely arrival
a few days before had saved their lives. The two
were in the midst of their work, the girl lifting
and hauling with all the strength of a man, and
they scarcely looked up as the party passed them,
although the old man responded with a wave of
his hand when Andy Rawlinson called to him.</p>

<p>"How's it goin', Dan?" asked the former.</p>

<p>"Oh, well enough, well enough," responded the
man, with what seemed to the girls enforced
cheerfulness. "We'll strike gold afore to-morrow,
sure."</p>

<p>"Poor old Dan Higgins," said Andy, with a
sobering of his good-natured face. "He's always
goin' to strike gold 'to-morrow.' Sure,
there's no one I'd rather see strike it rich than
Dan an' that girl of his. But I'm 'fraid they're
jest plumb unlucky. Funny thing, luck&mdash;and
gold," he went on to soliloquize. "Some young
fellers they come out here, thinkin' they can get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
back to the girl at home in a couple o' years with
their pockets plumb full o' nuggets, an' instead,
they toil their lives away till their hair grows
white an' their skin gets crackly like parchment,
an' never even a glimpse o' yellow. An' mebbe
the feller next to him drills a hole three feet deep
and he strikes a vein. Yes siree, if ever there
was a real thing in this world, that thing is
luck."</p>

<p>The girls were impressed and their hearts
ached for Dan Higgins, his years of hope and
work and his profitless mine. As for the girl, his
daughter, Meggy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you sure Dan Higgins hasn't any chance
of striking gold?" asked Betty, gravely.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," returned Andy Rawlinson
quickly. "There's gold all around here&mdash;everybody
thought Dan was mighty lucky when he
staked out his claim. He may find gold yet.
But," he added, and there was a fatalistic quality
in his tone that chilled the girls, "you always have
to reckon on luck."</p>

<p>In the days that followed it became quite the
usual thing to see the Outdoor Girls, mounted
on their splendid horses, galloping along the open
road or cantering through the town of Gold Run.
It was not long before they became general favorites
in this country where girls of their type<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
were scarce, and the girls knew most of the
rough but good-hearted miners by name. But
perhaps of them all, their best and staunchest
friends were old Dan Higgins and his daughter,
Meggy.</p>

<p>The girls often visited the mine and were always
greeted with the utmost heartiness by its
owners. Once Betty had caught Meggy looking
longingly at Nigger as he was trying his best to
get some nourishment from the stubbly grass,
and with the quick impulsiveness that was hers,
she asked the girl if she would like a ride.</p>

<p>At the sudden radiance that flooded Meggy's
face, Betty turned away abashed. She felt as
though she had been given a glimpse of the
girl's soul.</p>

<p>Meggy had her ride, and in the days that followed
she had many others and the girl's fondness
for Betty became almost worship. She
liked the other girls, for they were always kind
to her, but Betty was her idol.</p>

<p>"I have wanted all my life to own a horse,"
she confided to the Little Captain one day, as she
stroked Nigger's shining coat with almost reverent
fingers. "It would be the first thing I
would buy for myself if dad should strike it
rich." Her tone was brave, but the eyes that
sought her father's toiling figure were sad. "Poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
old dad," she said softly, "I don't think he would
keep on any longer, if it wasn't for me."</p>

<p>On one of their visits to the mine the girls
were astonished to find their mysterious musician
there ahead of them. He seemed to be trying to
help, but from where the girls watched unobserved,
it looked as though he were more in the
way than anything else.</p>

<p>Meggy was the first to discover them, and as
she called out a greeting, the Hermit of Gold Run
rose quickly to his feet and disappeared into the
woods.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," said Meggy, looking pityingly
after him. "We let him try to help us because
it seems to amuse him, but he really doesn't know
how to work with his hands. His fingers were
made for the fiddle."</p>

<p>"I certainly would like to find out more about
that man," said Mollie, her forehead puckered
into a puzzled frown. "He sure does act pretty
funny."</p>

<p>"We'll have to visit him again some day," said
Betty lightly, and then turned to question Meggy
on the progress of the mine.</p>

<p>On their way home they took up the subject
of the strange musician whose queer comings and
goings had begun to be of more than usual interest
to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"He acts&mdash;in a&mdash;a stealthy way," said Grace,
striving for the exact words to express her meaning.
"He positively sneaked away from us this
morning. It seems to me people don't act like
that unless they are afraid of something."</p>

<p>"He might just be afraid of people," Betty reminded
her. "Or he may dislike people and want
to be left alone. That would account for the
name of 'hermit' that the natives around here
have given him."</p>

<p>"But an ordinary hermit wouldn't be able to
play like a virtuoso," objected Amy.</p>

<p>"Well, nobody said he was an ordinary hermit,"
retorted Mollie.</p>

<p>"To change the subject before you girls get
to the hair-pulling stage," laughed Betty, as she
turned Nigger's head toward the ranch, "I wish
we could do something for Dan Higgins and
Meggy. It's a shame for that splendid, loyal girl
to have to spend all her youth, when she might be
having good times like other girls, in doing the
kind of work that's only fit for a man to do."</p>

<p>"And she's so brave about it, too," added Grace
admiringly. "She keeps her head up like a thoroughbred."</p>

<p>"I've asked her to come over to the ranch,"
Betty went on thoughtfully. "She has a passion
for horses, you know, and I told her we'd have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Andy Rawlinson pick her out a beauty from the
corrals. I could see that she was awfully tempted,
but she said no, she couldn't leave her father."</p>

<p>"Probably the real reason she refused was because
she hadn't decent clothes to wear," said
Mollie sagaciously. "The poor girl is almost in
rags."</p>

<p>"I wish we could help," sighed Betty. "But
she and her father are proud, like most of the
other people around here. They just have to
stand on their own feet."</p>

<p>"I wonder if they have enough to eat," mused
Amy. "It would be dreadful to think of them
actually hungry."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess there's no danger of that," said
Mollie. "As long as there are wild animals in
the woods and Dan Higgins and Meggy have
guns they won't starve to death."</p>

<p>"And maybe they really will find gold, anyway,"
said Grace hopefully.</p>

<p>They rode along silently for a while. In their
abstraction they had taken the long way home,
instead of cutting directly across the ranch in the
direction of the house. They were on a rather
narrow trail, so narrow, that they could not ride
two abreast but were strung out in single file,
Indian fashion. On one side of them rose the
mountain, huge and majestic, and on the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was a sheer drop of a hundred feet or so into a
rocky canyon.</p>

<p>The girls had always loved this ride because
of the wonderful view it afforded them of the
surrounding country. But that very morning
Dan Higgins had warned them not to go that
way.</p>

<p>"The mountain is pow'ful oncertain," the old
man had told them. "Part of it is apt to fall on
you any time if you get too close to it."</p>

<p>Betty thought of this warning, but too late.
An ominous rumbling jerked her eyes upward
and she saw a sight that almost froze the blood in
her veins. It seemed indeed to her terrified fancy
as if the whole mountain were falling upon them.
A great mass of dirt and brush and rock was
hurtling down upon them with sickening velocity.
A landslide&mdash;and they were directly in its path!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>IN THE CAVE</h3>


<p>Luck was with the Outdoor Girls that day&mdash;or
fate&mdash;call it what you will. In the side of the
mountain close to where they were, had been
drilled a hole forming a large, artificial cave&mdash;probably
the work of some miner who had abandoned
operations almost at the beginning either
from lack of funds or ambition.</p>

<p>Into this hole the girls dashed, driven on by
their frightful peril. Amy was the last to enter,
and she had barely urged her nervous little filly
into the opening when, with a terrific rumbling
and rattling, the mass of earth and stones fell,
covering the mouth of the cave and leaving them
in such absolute darkness that it seemed as if
they must suddenly have been stricken blind.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" moaned Amy, her trembling hand
striving vainly to quiet the frightened animal
under her. "We're buried alive, girls, we're
buried alive! We'll never get out of this&mdash;never!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please stop that, Amy," Betty's voice came
out of the darkness, harsh, unnatural, like the
crack of a whip. "The only danger we're in
is the danger of losing our heads. Whoa, there,
Nigger, old boy. Take it easy, beauty&mdash;there's
nothing to be frightened about&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;&mdash;"
and she crooned to the big beast soothingly.</p>

<p>Someway, the other girls managed to follow
her example, enough at least to quiet their restless
mounts. Grace was sobbing, more from nervousness
than fright, but she managed to say with
a catch in her breath, "Stand still, Nabob&mdash;don't
be such a s-silly. Isn't your Auntie Grace here
with you?"</p>

<p>But it was Mollie who had the real problem.
For while "Old Nick's" skittishness was more
amusing than dangerous in the open, here, in
this small place, with the other horses already
difficult to manage, any real panic on his part
would be more than likely to precipitate a real
tragedy.</p>

<p>In the dark, unable to see a foot before their
faces, only the power of their wills to prevent a
stampede of their panicky horses which would
mean death to them all and, worst of all, the
possibility of smothering or starving to death in
this walled-in cave! This was the appalling situation
which confronted the four Outdoor Girls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Mollie, her teeth grimly set, her knees dug into
Old Nick's sides, was doing her best to keep him
from trying to climb on the back of one of the
other horses.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mollie, make him stop it," cried Amy
frantically. "He'll kill poor Lady. Make him
stop!"</p>

<p>"What do you suppose I'm trying to do,"
gritted Mollie between clenched teeth. "Do you
think I like riding the side of a wall? Get down
there, Old Nick, you wicked beast. Just wait till
I get you outside."</p>

<p>Although this threat was uttered sternly, Mollie
had never been nearer to crying in her life.
Luckily, a cruel dig of her spurs in the horse's
side brought the big beast to his senses. He
dropped to the ground and stood there, quivering
in every muscle and nickering plaintively.</p>

<p>"Good work, Mollie, old girl," cried Betty's
voice encouragingly, and Mollie, wiping a tell-tale
drop from the corner of her nose, answered
in a voice that held never a quiver: "I couldn't
fail you, Little Captain. Not at a time like this,"
and then she felt very brave and heroic.</p>

<p>The horses were quiet, huddled together at the
farther end of the cave as though they found comfort
in company, and thus one great danger was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
passed. But the girls had still the other and
greater one to face.</p>

<p>"We'd better dismount," said Betty's voice, surprisingly
calm and matter-of-fact. It was this
ability of Betty Nelson's to keep her nerve and
her head in any difficulty, to see almost at a
glance the best thing to do and the best way to do
it, that had led the girls to call her their Little
Captain. And now as they listened to her cool
voice, directing them as always in an emergency,
some of her self-control communicated itself to
them and they followed her leadership without
question.</p>

<p>"The horses will stand quietly now, I think,"
she said, and swung herself cautiously from Nigger's
tall back and felt her way slowly past the
horses, out to the small open space between them
and what had once been the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>The girls followed her example, the horses
making no protest, save to whinny anxiously and
crowd a little closer together.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Betty?" cried Grace plaintively,
stubbing her toe on a stone and emitting
an injured "ouch."</p>

<p>"I'm over here," responded Betty reassuringly.
"Stretch out your hand and I'll grab it."</p>

<p>"Oh, for a match, my kingdom for a match!"
said Mollie, brushing her hand across her eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
as though to relieve them of the weight of that
terrific darkness. "Why aren't we men so we
could carry 'em in our pockets&mdash;the matches I
mean, not the men," she added with a chuckle that
ended in a sob.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are," said Grace, when they had
found each other in the inky blackness. "Now
you've got us, Betty, what are you going to do
with us?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;yet," responded Betty honestly.
"I guess we've got to talk it over and decide what
it is best to do."</p>

<p>Amy groaned.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile we smother," she said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," retorted Betty briskly. "There's
enough air in this place to keep us alive for
twenty-four hours at least."</p>

<p>"Twenty-four hours," protested Amy, the panic
she had felt at the first threatening to overwhelm
her again. "But, Betty, there isn't a chance in the
world that anybody will come along here in the
next twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"That's right, too," agreed Mollie, a prickly
sensation of pure fright tickling the roots of her
hair. "Dan Higgins said this trail was practically
never used because of the danger from the mountain.
This is a pretty pickle, this is!"</p>

<p>"And even if anybody should come along,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Grace pointed out gloomily, "they couldn't be
expected to guess that there are four girls and
four horses buried in this hole in the wall."</p>

<p>"And I don't believe we could ever in the world
make ourselves heard through that mass of rocks
and dirt," added Mollie. "Looks as though we
had just about come to the end of our rope, I
should say."</p>

<p>Amy began to cry again softly, and Betty, who
had been listening with increasing irritation to
this conversation, burst forth indignantly:</p>

<p>"Of all the silly things I ever heard!" she denounced
them hotly, "I think you girls are the
worst. You seem to forget that you are Outdoor
Girls and that we have been in a good many tight
places that were almost as bad as this. Why, we
can't expect to have good times and adventures
without once in a while getting the worst of it.
If this is the way you are going to take a little
bad luck," she finished her tirade in a fury that
whipped the girls like a lash, "then I'm through,
that's all. I refuse to be one of four Outdoor
Girls that don't deserve the name."</p>

<p>She paused, and the girls were silent for a moment,
feeling a little dazed. The tongue-lashing
had been just what they needed, as Betty very
well knew. It made them angry.</p>

<p>"Oh well," said Mollie sullenly, "if you are so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
much better than the rest of us, Betty, perhaps
you can tell us what to do. I'm sure we would be
just as glad to get out of this as you."</p>

<p>"Then help me think of some way to do it,"
Betty retorted, more quietly. "Surely we can't
accomplish it by making up our minds ahead of
time that we are doomed."</p>

<p>"Suppose you suggest something, yourself,"
said Grace resentfully.</p>

<p>"All right," said Betty, whose quick mind had
been working busily. "I am as sure as you girls
are that the possibility of rescue from anybody
outside is slight. Of course," she added breathlessly,
"when we don't come home dad and mother
would become worried and start a search party."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't miss us before night though,"
said Grace.</p>

<p>"Exactly," Betty caught her up. "And at night
they wouldn't be as apt to discover the landslide
as they would in the daylight. They would
naturally think of the woods first. But the next
day, anybody familiar with the trail would be
sure to notice that there had been a landslide and
they would be almost sure to connect it with
us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Betty," wailed Grace, forgetting that a
moment before she had been angry with the Little
Captain, "all that is just supposition, and you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
know as well as we do that we are likely not to
be discovered until&mdash;until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's too late," finished Mollie. "Why don't
you say it? It's the truth."</p>

<p>"And since it is the truth," Betty took her up
briskly, "there is all the more reason why we
should take things in our own hands and work
out our own salvation."</p>

<p>Betty impatiently cut short Amy's discouraged
"How?"</p>

<p>"Now listen," she said. "There are plenty of
stones in this cave&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My toes cry aloud that they know it," interjected
Grace, but no one laughed&mdash;they were too
intent upon Betty. They were beginning to realize
what she had in mind, and the realization
brought a thrill of hope.</p>

<p>"If we could find any sharp enough&mdash;stones
I mean," Betty went on, "we might use them as a
sort of shovel and try to dig our way out. Of
course," she added, as the girls began to grope
eagerly among the dirt and d&eacute;bris at their feet
for stones sharp enough to answer the purpose,
"the mouth of the cave may be choked up too
solidly with dirt and underbrush and things for
us to get through. But in that case we'd just
have to think up some other way, that's all."</p>

<p>"I've got a peach," cried Mollie slangily, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
her hand struck a big stone sharp enough to serve
her purpose. "I ought to be able to dig my way
through the side of a house with this fellow."</p>

<p>"And here's the very one that got too familiar
with my toe," said Grace, as she picked up another
serviceable stone. "I'm going to get even
with it now. I shall make it work as it never
worked before."</p>

<p>After much groping and knocking of heads
together, Betty and Amy also armed themselves
with imitation shovels, and so the work began.</p>

<p>And it was work indeed. For what seemed
hours to the anxious girls they toiled, digging
sometimes with the stones, sometimes in desperation
with their hands until it seemed to them they
must have dug their way half through the mountainside.
And still that blank wall of dirt, that
impenetrable darkness, that stubborn barrier between
them and the blessed sunshine. Amy was
the first to give way.</p>

<p>She sank back on the dank floor of the cave and
buried her face in her dirt-stained hands.</p>

<p>"We'll never get out of here!" she sobbed.
"And I'm st-starving to d-death!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>IN THE DARKNESS</h3>


<p>Now the girls had been hungry before the
accident occurred and, it being several hours
since then, they were, by this time, as any one
could readily see, in a rather bad state. Therefore,
Amy's complaint was very unfortunate and,
had it not been for Betty, it might have ruined
the morale of the girls completely.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Amy, don't talk about starving
to death," cried Mollie, dismayed. "That's coming
too near the truth for comfort. Oh, this
miserable stone. It's cutting clear through my
hand!"</p>

<p>"And my back is nearly broken," said Grace,
adding, as she turned ferociously upon the still-sobbing
Amy: "Stop that crying, Amy Blackford.
Don't you know it is catching?" and a suspicious
break at the end of her sentence, proved
the truth of the assertion.</p>

<p>"Girls, please don't," begged Betty, still digging
automatically at the stubborn wall of stones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and dirt. "If you all begin to cry, then we might
just as well throw up our hands and say we are
beaten."</p>

<p>It was not long after that that the girls found
what they called their "second wind." They forgot
that they were ravenous, that their backs
ached and that their hands were scratched and
torn. They worked furiously in the darkness,
their goal the out-of-doors they loved so well.</p>

<p>For a long time they did not notice that the air
was becoming very close and oppressive and that
the perspiration that bothered them so was caused
not alone by their exertion. And when the realization
did come it had the effect of goading them
on to more furious effort.</p>

<p>That the horses also felt the change in the atmosphere,
was attested to by their increased nervousness.
The trampling of their hoofs sounded
ominous to the girls&mdash;they made queer little puffing
noises as if they were getting their breath
with greater and greater difficulty.</p>

<p>In one terrible instant the girls realized what
might happen when what was discomfort to the
animals now, should become torture. Maddened
by pain and fright, it would be no longer possible
to quiet them. And then&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you think we'd better stop and try to
quiet the horses?" asked Mollie once, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
champing and snorting in the blackness behind
them became more marked.</p>

<p>"I don't think it would do any good," Betty
answered between clenched teeth as she scooped
and dug, scooped and dug. "Better keep on working,
girls. It's the one chance we have."</p>

<p>Oh, the horror of it, the nightmare of it! The
heavy air, the hideous dark, the nervous trampling
of those death-bearing hoofs&mdash;&mdash; The
girls spoke no longer. They were beyond speech.
Almost maddened by terror themselves, they
scooped and dug, scooped and dug&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Once they thought they heard voices outside,
and shrilly they cried to their imaginary rescuers.
No answering "hallo" reached them, and the only
effect of their cries seemed to be to add to the
fright of their horses and so endanger themselves
still more.</p>

<p>On, on, on&mdash;while their aching muscles seemed
to grow numb with the strain and their lungs
nearly burst with the pressure upon them.</p>

<p>At last they gave in&mdash;it seemed that they had
to give in. All except Betty, who kept on desperately,
doggedly, her muscles barely able to respond
to the last call she was making upon them.</p>

<p>"I can't go on any more. I'm all in," said
Mollie, a desperate quiet in her voice. "My arms
are like lead and my hands are so numb I can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
feel the stone. I guess this is the last adventure
of the Outdoor Girls. We have just had one too
many, that's all."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mollie!" Betty drew in a labored breath
that caught on a sob. "Please don't give up&mdash;please!
I've counted on you&mdash;&mdash;" she paused,
jerked her head up, her attention turned on the
spot where her hand still automatically dug at
the earth.</p>

<p>She sniffed, experimentally, sniffed again, stilling
the wild throb of hope that was almost a pain
at her heart.</p>

<p>"What is it, Betty, what is it?" cried Mollie,
sensing something strange. Amy and Grace
fought off the dizziness that was stealing over
them and leaned forward.</p>

<p>But Betty had jumped to her feet, had dropped
the stone and was tearing with her bare hands
at that thin place&mdash;that thin place&mdash;&mdash; It gave
under her mad onslaught, and suddenly her hand
slipped through into the air&mdash;the air&mdash;&mdash; A
breath of it swept into her tortured lungs, and
she leaned there, laughing, crying, the tears of
sheer weakness running down her dirt-stained
face.</p>

<p>"Girls!" she babbled, "out there is the air&mdash;the
good old air&mdash;enough of it for all of us!
We're saved, do you hear? We're saved!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Exhausted as they were, the girls tore at the
tiny hole that Betty had made until there was an
opening big enough for them to crawl through.</p>

<p>And oh! the indescribable ecstasy of it, the joy
of it, just to lie there, trembling with weakness,
and drink in great drafts of that life-giving air,
thinking of nothing, caring for nothing but that
they were alive there in their great out-of-doors.
One never comes really to appreciate life until
one has been close to death.</p>

<p>It was a long time before they ventured to go
on. They had not realized how near exhaustion
they had been until the tension had relaxed.
When at last they did start for home, on foot,
they were still trembling and they dared not
glance down the canyon at their right for fear
of becoming dizzy.</p>

<p>They had been long hours in the cave, and
when they finally left the trail and cut across
the plain toward the ranch it was nearly dark.
They did not realize the startling sight they must
present to any one who might not know of their
plight until they met Andy Rawlinson and some
other boys from the ranch starting out to search
for them.</p>

<p>At sight of the mud-stained, blood-stained Outdoor
Girls, Andy Rawlinson fairly tumbled from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
his pony and came running toward them while
the other boys stood agape.</p>

<p>"What in the world&mdash;&mdash;" began Andy, but
Betty stopped him with a weary gesture. As
briefly as she could she told him what had happened
and asked him to go back and get their
horses.</p>

<p>"It's getting pretty dark now, you know," she
reminded him, when he seemed inclined to linger
and ask questions. "Soon you won't be able to
see what you're doing. Won't you please hurry?"</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know," responded the boy
quickly, his nice eyes full of sympathy for them.
"Some of the boys will see you home&mdash;your folks
are getting awfully worried about you, you know&mdash;and
the rest of us will go on and dig out the
poor bronchos. So long. We'll be back pronto."</p>

<p>"And now home," sighed Betty, as she looked
at the ranch house just visible in the distance.
"And a bath&mdash;and something to eat. What does
that sound like, girls?"</p>

<p>"Heaven!" they answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE LURE OF GOLD</h3>


<p>The task of releasing the imprisoned horses
was not such an easy task as the girls and even
Andy Rawlinson had thought it would be.</p>

<p>In the first place, it took Andy and his company
some time to discover the place along the trail
where the landslide had occurred, for Betty's account
had been hasty and excited and she had
overlooked several details that might have helped
them in their work.</p>

<p>And when they did reach the scene of what
might have been a tragedy the ranch hands were
appalled by the immensity of the landslide.
There had been several small ones in that vicinity,
but this was what Andy termed a "humdinger."</p>

<p>There was a stamping and snorting from inside
that dirt-choked cavern that, there in that lonely
spot on the very edge of night, seemed positively
uncanny to the men who stood and listened.</p>

<p>"Better get busy, boys," said Andy suddenly.
"Those hosses ain't goin' to get any easier in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
they minds an' it's about time we dug 'em out of
there. Back to Gold Run as fast as we can get
there for the right kind of tools from the miners.
We may need some more men, too. Gosh, but I
didn't know it was as bad as that," he added with
a glance over his shoulder as he turned his pony
and dashed back down the trail in the direction of
Gold Run. "Reckon 'twas just plain grit that
got those girls out."</p>

<p>Back in Gold Run they found several miners
who were willing to offer both themselves and
their tools toward the work of liberation, and
soon the cowboys returned, accompanied by men
with lanterns, and fell to work with a will.</p>

<p>Two hours later, Andy Rawlinson ventured
into the blackness of the cave, swinging his lantern
before him, and led forth the first of the
frightened horses.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the girls had bathed away the stains
of their adventure, and after a hearty meal cooked
by an over solicitous "Miz Cummins" and served
by a frankly envious and inquisitive Lizzie, they
felt considerably more like their old self-confident
selves.</p>

<p>However, they begged not to have to go to bed,
as Mrs. Nelson anxiously suggested, until the
boys had returned with their horses.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to get dreadfully worried,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Betty confessed after an interval of staring out
into the darkness. They were on the biggest of
the many porches boasted by the quaint old ranch
house, waiting eagerly for the first sound that
would announce the return of Andy and the others
with their horses.</p>

<p>"I'd never get over it if anything happened to
Old Nick," said Mollie, taking up Betty's theme.
"Maybe we'd better borrow some other horses
from the corral and follow them."</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," said Mr. Nelson,
his voice sounding unusually stern there in
the darkness. "I am going to keep my eye on you
for the rest of to-day, at least!"</p>

<p>And so they contented themselves as well as
they could with waiting and finally were rewarded
by the regular beat of galloping horses in
the distance.</p>

<p>"They're coming!" cried Betty, springing to
her feet, then turned to her father pleadingly:
"You won't mind if we go down to meet them,
will you, Dad?" she asked. "They are our
chums, you know&mdash;the horses, I mean."</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson nodded, and down the steps the
girls sprang, racing out to meet that sound of
galloping hoofs which was coming ever nearer.
A few minutes later they were caressing the nervous
animals that had gone with them into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
very shadow of death, rubbing their noses, laughing
and crying over them and calling them endearing
names till it's a wonder the cowboys, who
stood by, grinning sympathetically, did not turn
green with envy.</p>

<p>"Some anymiles do have all the luck," said
one of them.</p>

<p>After that the girls and their horses were almost
inseparable. If left to themselves, the latter
would follow the girls around like dogs. Even
"Old Nick," who had been the most difficult to
understand and win, now was devoted to Mollie.
She was the only one who could quiet him, and
though there were some who did not care to ride
him because of his skittishness, he was never
anything but gentle and docile with her.</p>

<p>As the days passed the girls became more and
more interested in Meggy Higgins until the longing
to give her one good time, in spite of her
pride, became almost an obsession with them.</p>

<p>One day Betty begged so hard that the girl
finally consented to take a holiday and go out
with them for a day's fun. But Meggy surrendered
reluctantly, in spite of the fact that this invitation
of the girls had been like a glimpse of
wonderland to her.</p>

<p>"I reckon dad can get along one day without
me, specially as the hermit can do part of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
work. Pa's broke him in so he can be real helpful
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she got no farther, for Betty threw her
arms around the surprised girl and hugged her
happily.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully glad!" she cried, adding with
eyes that sparkled: "I tell you what I'll do. I'll
let you ride Nigger. There's a darling little
brown colt over at the ranch that I've been just
dying to try out."</p>

<p>Sudden tears sprang to Meggy's eyes, and with
the disgust of all mountain folk for the expression
of sentiment, she turned away impatiently to hide
this tell-tale sign of weakness. But Betty had
glimpsed the tears and she was satisfied.</p>

<p>The day was all that even Meggy Higgins'
starved imagination could have expected of it.
The miner's daughter was so beatifically happy
that the girls found a new and most satisfying
thrill in her enjoyment.</p>

<p>All her short, work-driven life Meggy Higgins
had wanted a horse, a beautiful, sleek animal
with supple limbs and shining coat like the one
that she was riding now&mdash;Betty's Nigger. Many
have desired a fortune, some political fame, others
social position, but Meggy merely desired a
horse. And even this had been denied her because
her father had been dazzled by the lure of gold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a fortune always just before his eyes, but never to
be grasped.</p>

<p>The girls were sorry for old Dan Higgins and
his thwarted hopes. But they were infinitely
more sorry for this girl of his to whom hardship
was a daily reality and pleasure a golden vision
to be indulged in only by girls whose fathers did
not own a worthless claim.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," spoke up Mollie, as she reined
Old Nick into a walk, "I wish I had the courage
to rob somebody else's mine, Meggy, and plant
the gold in yours. It doesn't seem fair for you to
work all the time and get nothing for it."</p>

<p>The girl smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"I'm used to that," she said, with a grim philosophy
far beyond her years. Then she added,
with a quick loyalty that made the girls' hearts
warm to her: "I don't mind. I'd do anything
for dad an' I guess if he thought I was gettin'
discouraged he'd jest plum up an' quit. He's gittin'
old, he is, an' he ain't that spry like he used
to be. All he has is his hope in that mine&mdash;an'
me. Ef you killed that you might as well kill
him."</p>

<p>After a while they stopped in the shade of
some stunted trees and had lunch. The girls
could tell from Meggy's popping eyes that the
delicacies they drew forth from Miz Cummins'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
lunch basket had never been dreamed of in all her
hum-drum, joyless life.</p>

<p>Tongue sandwiches, buttered corn-bread, fried
chicken that you were at perfect liberty to take
up in your fingers and nibble to your heart's content,
jelly and olives and hot cocoa in the thermos
bottle with rich cream already in it&mdash;truly a feast
even worthy of the Outdoor Girls!</p>

<p>After lunch the girls strolled around a bit,
leaving their mounts to graze lazily. They talked
of many things, the adventures they had had,
the curious people they had met in their adventuring,
while Meggy listened to it all, drinking
it in thirstily.</p>

<p>"To think of all the things you've seen," she
breathed at last. "An' I've spent all my time
sence I was able to toddle, I reckon, betwixt our
cabin an' the mine&mdash;back an' forth, back an'
forth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>After that they rode on again and it was quite
late in the day when they decided it was time to
be going back.</p>

<p>"I don't see," said Grace, as they neared the
ranch, "why we don't lay out some claims and
start digging ourselves, girls. The north end of
this ranch is quite near the other mines. We
might strike gold."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The words were spoken laughingly, but Meggy
took them seriously.</p>

<p>"Mebbe there's some truth in that," she said
soberly. "Dad allus reckoned they might be gold
on Gold Run Ranch."</p>

<p>A short time later they left her at the mine and
Betty mounted Nigger, leading the brown colt by
the reins. Meggy had tried to stammer some
words of thanks, but the girls would have none
of it. They waved to her gayly and started for
home.</p>

<p>After an unusually long and thoughtful silence,
Amy spoke up softly.</p>

<p>"Betty," she said, "if Meggy is right about the
ranch, there being gold here, I mean, then what
your mother had thought all along may turn out
to be the truth."</p>

<p>"Well," said Betty, a joyous lilt to her voice
that the girls knew well, "Allen will be here in a
few days and then we'll start our gold hunt.
Gold!" she repeated softly. "There is something
romantic in the very sound of it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>A DISCOVERY</h3>


<p>Up to this time the weather had been remarkably
fine, but on this particular morning the
Outdoor Girls woke to find that the sky was
overcast and there was every indication of a
stormy day.</p>

<p>"Oh bother," grumbled Mollie, as after their
breakfast she gloomily surveyed the landscape
from the cretonne-curtained window. "Just as
I was about to suggest a real adventure, too!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;'real adventure?'"
queried Grace, lazily. The day before she had
bought a new box of candy and a magazine, and
so it happened that she was the only one of the
four of them who really did not care whether it
rained or not.</p>

<p>Mollie turned from the window and regarded
them resentfully. Then she looked more hopeful
as her eyes rested on Betty, who was sorting the
contents of a too-crowded dresser drawer.</p>

<p>"You are with me, anyway, aren't you, Betty?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
she asked, almost wistfully. "We'll leave these
other two at home, and you and I will go on our
adventure."</p>

<p>"All right," said Betty, with a lack of enthusiasm
that fell with a dampening effect upon Mollie's
ears. The disastrous quality of their last adventure
had had a dampening effect on the girls'
enthusiasm for this form of entertainment, and
for the present they preferred the safety of the
ranch to the lure of the great unknown, as it
were. However, this condition of mind was only
temporary. They would soon be as eager as ever
for new experiences. "I'm game for anything,
Mollie dear, as long as you keep away from land-slides
and wild animals."</p>

<p>"Just hear the child!" said Mollie disgustedly.
"As if an adventure would be an adventure without
a little danger mixed in!"</p>

<p>"Just what is your great idea, Mollie?" asked
Betty mildly. Mollie was beginning to glower.
And if somebody did not stop her at the beginning,
there was sure to be a fracas. Betty knew
this from experience. "Suppose you tell us about
it and get it out of your system. As I said before,
I'm willing to do anything if it isn't hunting
lions and tigers."</p>

<p>Mollie grunted disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Well, there isn't a thing really exciting about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
it, if that's what you mean," she said. "I just
thought that since we had nothing special to do
to-day we might visit the Hermit of Gold Run
again. We might be able to solve the mystery
about him in some way," she added as a special
inducement, since the girls still seemed unenthusiastic.</p>

<p>Grace laughed indulgently.</p>

<p>"Just how do you expect to solve this mystery?"
she asked, with a giggle. "You certainly
can't do it by looking at him."</p>

<p>"Oh well, if that's the way you feel," retorted
Mollie, feeling very much abused, "I'm sorry I
spoke about it. Only I thought we had already
decided to pay him a visit."</p>

<p>"And so we had," said Betty, closing the
dresser <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'draw'">drawer</ins> with a bang and coming unexpectedly
to her aid. "And I, for one, am with you
in that, Mollie. I have felt from the first," she
went on earnestly, while Mollie regarded her with
growing hope, "that I had not only heard the
selection that that man played but that I had
seen him somewhere before&mdash;quite a long time
ago."</p>

<p>Impressed by Betty's earnestness, Grace had
laid down her magazine and Amy was becoming
interested.</p>

<p>"I know it's ridiculous," Betty continued, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
though to justify herself, "but I can't help feeling
that way, just the same."</p>

<p>"That thing he played sounded familiar to me,
too," Grace admitted, now entirely abandoning
her magazine and sitting up. "It has been haunting
me ever since we heard him playing that day,
and yet I can't think of the name of it."</p>

<p>Softly Amy began to hum a popular song, but
Mollie interrupted her impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well then, since you all feel that way about
it," she said eagerly, "I don't see why it wouldn't
be fun to scout around his cabin a little bit and
see if we can't pick up some information. I'm
really curious about him."</p>

<p>"All right, let's," said Betty, with the decision
for which she was famed. "Get your riding
togs on, girls, and we'll play detective."</p>

<p>This time it was Mollie who held back.</p>

<p>"How about the weather?" she demurred.
"Looks as if we were likely to get wet."</p>

<p>"Who cares?" said Betty airily, adding, as she
stopped at the door to make them a little bow:
"It would give us an excuse to see His Highness
again."</p>

<p>Half an hour later they had saddled their ponies
and were cantering off briskly to visit the Hermit
of Gold Run.</p>

<p>"Aren't you a little bit afraid to go in there?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
asked Amy, reining in as they reached the narrow
trail through the woods that led near the
musician's cabin. "We might run into some
wolves, as we did that other time."</p>

<p>"We were much further in the woods than the
Hermit's cabin," said Mollie impatiently. "And
it was in an entirely different direction, too. Go
ahead, silly, or I'll ride right over you," and as
she was urging Old Nick forward until he
crowded uncomfortably against the little white
filly, Amy had no other course but to do as she
was bid.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she was not the only one who
was uneasy, and it might have been observed that
the girls glanced often into the shadows of the
underbrush on either side of the narrow trail.</p>

<p>There were wild animals in that forest, as they
had good reason to know, and though they seldom
ventured this close to civilization, still there was
no use in tempting fate!</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was as far in as this," said
Grace, after they had ridden some distance in
silence. "Are you sure we haven't passed the
cabin, Betty?"</p>

<p>"Why, we aren't nearly there yet," was Betty's
discomforting reply. "It's quite a way beyond
that next turn in the trail."</p>

<p>Grace said nothing, but she gripped the reins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
harder in her hands. She had made up her
mind that at the first sign of danger she would
turn Nabob and make a dash back down the
trail for safety.</p>

<p>After that the silence became so pronounced
that Mollie noticed it and laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"Why all the noise?" she asked jocosely. "It
nearly breaks my ear drums."</p>

<p>"Hush," cried Amy warningly. "I thought I
heard something."</p>

<p>"That was your own heart hammering against
the tree trunks," retorted Mollie dryly, at which
the girls giggled and the tension relaxed.</p>

<p>"Let's talk about something nice," Betty suggested.
"Gold, for instance."</p>

<p>"Or Allen," teased Grace. "I reckon you won't
be glad or anything when he gets here."</p>

<p>"I guess mother will be gladder than any of
us," replied Betty promptly, trying to shift the
spotlight from herself. "She was so excited
when I told her what Dan Higgins said about the
possibility of there being gold on the ranch that
she hardly closed her eyes all night. I told her
she was getting to be a regular adventuress."</p>

<p>"Like her daughter," said Mollie, with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>"Just think of the story we can tell the boys
when we get home," said Amy rapturously, add<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>ing
apologetically as the girls glanced at her:
"If we find the gold, I mean."</p>

<p>"Listen to the child!" cried Betty gayly, while
the other girls laughed. "And we haven't begun
to dig yet. Hold your horses, Amy dear, hold
your horses."</p>

<p>They did this very thing literally the next moment,
for they came in sight of the queer little
cabin of the man whom the natives called the
Hermit of Gold Run.</p>

<p>Quickly they jumped down, tethered the horses
as they had done before on the day when they had
first made the acquaintance of this remarkable
man, and started rather hesitantly down the path
toward the house.</p>

<p>As they came nearer the haunting strains of
the music that had puzzled them before once
more floated out through the open windows and
they paused, lost once again in the spell of it.</p>

<p>The music stopped, and they went on, hardly
knowing what their next move was to be, yet
drawn irresistibly by their curiosity. Then once
more they heard the violin, but evidently the
mood of the player had changed. The melody
fraught with pathos, wailing, pleading, no longer
reached them. The theme had changed&mdash;light,
airy, sparkling, it reminded the girls of fairies
dancing on the grass in the moonlight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Mollie grasped Betty's arm.</p>

<p>"I know that!" she cried excitedly. "It's something
of Chopin's, a nocturne, I think. Girls, I
know where I heard that selection played just
that way before."</p>

<p>They gazed at her, their eyes asking the question
before their lips could form it.</p>

<p>"At the Hostess House!" cried Mollie. "Don't
you remember that concert we gave with some
of the great artists?"</p>

<p>"That big benefit!" cried Betty excitedly.
"You've got it, Mollie! That's what I was trying
to think of!"</p>

<p>"Sh-h," said Grace, a finger to her lips. "He
has stopped playing. He may hear us."</p>

<p>"All right," said Betty. "Let's get back to the
trail where we can talk this thing over."</p>

<p>They did not stop at the trail, however, for
some memory of the danger lurking in the woods
drove them out on to the main road where they
might talk in peace.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Betty eagerly, as they
reached the road, crowding their horses close together
and reining them in to a walk. "What do
you make of this, girls? If this man is really one
of those artists that played at that big concert,
then he is famous and there is something more
than strange in his hiding up here in the woods."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Goodness, we don't need anybody to tell us
that," said Grace. "He certainly must be in hiding
for something he's done&mdash;unless he has been
disappointed in love," she added sentimentally.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he was ever in love with anything
but his violin," said Mollie.</p>

<p>"Can't somebody think of the name of the
violinist that played at the benefit?" asked Betty,
who had been trying for some minutes past to
accomplish that very thing.</p>

<p>"It was something like Croup, I think," said
Mollie, wrinkling her forehead.</p>

<p>"Goodness, how romantic," said Grace, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"I tell you how we can find out the name,"
said Amy suddenly.</p>

<p>"How?" they questioned.</p>

<p>"I think I have a program, and I can send
home for it," said Amy.</p>

<p>"Good girl!" cried Mollie, slapping her on the
back with a violence that nearly threw her from
Lady's back and caused that gentle little animal
to turn her head inquiringly. "We little thought
we had a genius in our midst!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>ALLEN ARRIVES</h3>


<p>Amy was delighted with the praise she received
from the girls and the first thing she did
after they returned to the ranch was to write
home to her guardian for the concert program
she had so luckily saved.</p>

<p>Naturally the girls were more curious than ever
after this second trip to his little cabin in the
woods and longed to find out about this strange
musician who hid himself so persistently from
the world.</p>

<p>"Of course," Grace said, during one of the
many times when they talked the matter over,
"we're not at all sure that the Hermit is the same
man who played at our benefit."</p>

<p>"Of course we're not," Mollie agreed with her.
"There must be a great many musicians who can
play those same selections that we heard him
play."</p>

<p>"That's all very true," said Betty argumentatively.
"But if he is really this same musician<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that played at our benefit, then that explains the
queer hunch I've had of having seen him somewhere
before."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mollie resignedly, "I guess all
we can do for the present is to wait until Amy
gets her program. When we find out the name
of the violinist that played for us then we can
decide what to do next about the Hermit."</p>

<p>Reluctantly they admitted that what she said
was true, and for the time being let the discussion
rest there.</p>

<p>Then came the day when Betty received a letter
from Allen announcing that he would reach Gold
Run the following afternoon on the four-thirty-five
train. The letter ended by begging her to
meet the train herself and please not to send any
one else, for no one else would do!</p>

<p>Betty's pretty face flushed a deeper pink and
her eyes shone brighter as she read this passage&mdash;and
two or three others&mdash;several times over.
Then she went to find the girls and tell them the
good news.</p>

<p>They also had received mail from the other
boys and some of the folks at home, and she
found them all together on the eastern porch
having the time of their lives. Mollie and Amy
were perched on the railing while Grace and a
box of candy reposed in a hammock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, have you finished reading yours already?"
Mollie greeted the Little Captain as she
swung up the steps. "It was such a fat one I
thought it would take you till lunch time at least
to get through with it."</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself," retorted Betty, too happy
to mind being teased. "Guess what, girls!" she
added, unable to keep the news to herself for
another minute, "Allen arrives via the Western
Limited at four-thirty or thereabouts to-morrow
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Hooray!" cried the girls, and momentarily
forgot their own letters in very real delight. Allen
Washburn was a favorite with all of them.</p>

<p>"Will you let us all go to meet him, Betty
dear?" asked Grace, with a twinkling smile.
"Or does he insist on seeing you alone?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," retorted Betty good-naturedly.
"I know he would take it as a personal
slight if you weren't all there to welcome him."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," Mollie commented ruefully.
"Something tells me he would manage to
live through it even if we weren't there. But go
on, Betty," she added. "Tell us what else he has
to say."</p>

<p>"That's pretty nearly all," said Betty truthfully.
"He said he would save all the news until
he saw me&mdash;us. One thing he did say," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
added, dimpling: "The boys are simply wild with
jealousy. They say it is all a deep dark scheme
on Allen's part to get out here with us."</p>

<p>"Us!" repeated Grace, with a giggle. "Much
he cares about the rest of us."</p>

<p>Be that as it may, they certainly all turned out
that following afternoon to meet the Western
Limited which was bearing Allen swiftly toward
them.</p>

<p>There was the usual gathering of picturesquely
garbed miners and cow-punchers on the platform,
and for most of these the girls had a smile and a
nod.</p>

<p>"Seems funny to think how strange everything
looked to us when we first came," remarked
Grace, as they waited for the train. "Now we
feel as much at home as if we had lived here
all our lives."</p>

<p>"The people are all so nice and friendly, too,"
said Amy. "It's wonderful how soon you come
to know them."</p>

<p>"It is a nice atmosphere," Betty agreed. "At
home in the East we want to know pretty much
all there is to know about people we make our
friends. But out here they take you for granted.
Nobody seems to care where you came from or
who your relatives are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Huh," grunted Mollie. "I guess in a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
many cases it wouldn't do to be too curious,"
she said cynically. "If you believe the stories
you read and the movies you see everybody who
has committed a crime anywhere from petty larceny
to murder skips out West to escape just punishment."</p>

<p>"Then at this moment," drawled Grace, glancing
around at the rather harmless looking crowd
on the station platform, "we are surrounded by
thieves and murderers. Though I must say they
are a pretty nice looking set," she added, and the
girls giggled.</p>

<p>"Grace could forgive a man anything, if he
was only good-looking enough," remarked Amy.</p>

<p>"Here comes the train!" cried Betty suddenly,
as the Western Limited thundered around a curve
in the distance and steamed toward them. Immediately
she forgot everything but that Allen
was on that train and that in a moment more
she would see him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then Allen himself, handsome as ever, eagerly
scanning the faces on the platform as he jumped
from the train the instant the porter opened the
door.</p>

<p>It took him barely a moment to discover the
group of girls, and he came toward them, hand
outstretched, eyes alight with greeting.</p>

<p>"Well, if this isn't great!" he cried in his hearty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
voice, shaking hands with all of them but looking
mostly at Betty. "Knew I could trust the
Outdoor Girls to turn out for a rousing welcome.
How's everything?"</p>

<p>"Just fine," they assured him, and then Betty
took him in hand.</p>

<p>"We've brought a wagon along from the ranch
to carry your luggage," she said, dragging him
over to the wagon beside which two of the boys
from the ranch were waiting bashfully. "Come
over and meet a couple of our cow-punchers, and
they will help you load your trunk on board."</p>

<p>All this accomplished, the cowboys and Allen
having formed an immediate and staunch friendship,
Betty introduced the latter to the horse she
had brought for him to ride. The pony was a
magnificent animal, dark brown in color with
a curve to his graceful neck and a flash to his
eye that proclaimed his thoroughbred ancestry.</p>

<p>"Say, you old peach of a horse," said Allen,
fondly stroking the soft muzzle, "you're just
about the most perfect thing of your kind I've
ever seen. It seems almost a sacrilege to ride
you."</p>

<p>"His name is Lightning," Amy volunteered.
"The boys call him that because he can outrun
almost any other horse on the ranch. Though,"
she added loyally, "I shouldn't wonder if Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
could beat him if they should give her a head
start."</p>

<p>This characteristic speech brought a laugh, and
Allen regarded the four other beautiful horses
in the group.</p>

<p>"You girls seemed to have picked winners yourselves,"
he said admiringly. He studied them
a moment, then his eyes narrowed quizzically as
he turned to Betty.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you a box of candy against a pair of
gloves," he said, "that I can tell which horse belongs
to which. Do you take me?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Betty. "Go ahead."</p>

<p>He guessed them nearly right, except that he
gave Nigger to Mollie and Old Nick to Betty.</p>

<p>"Almost does not avail," sang Betty gayly.
"You owe me a box of candy, Allen Washburn."</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment laughing, and
suddenly her gaze faltered. There had been
something new and forceful about Allen ever
since he had come back from the war that had
made Betty a little afraid of him. But she did
not think any the less of him&mdash;oh, no indeed!</p>

<p>"I'll give you a dozen of them if you'll take
them," he was saying ardently&mdash;evidently in reference
to the candies.</p>

<p>"And if she won't take 'em, I will," said Grace,
with a gusto that made them all laugh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>On the way home the girls, with what they
thought was great consideration, cantered along
in front, leaving Allen and Betty to bring up the
rear. Allen blessed them for it, but Betty was
furious and kept up such a running fire of comment
and laughing narrative that Allen had no
chance to say the things he had wanted to say.</p>

<p>Only once as they neared the ranch she paused
a moment, pointing out over the dazzling plains
to the purple tipped mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>"Isn't the country beautiful, Allen?" she asked
breathlessly. "I've fallen dead in love with it."</p>

<p>"It looks too good to be true," Allen agreed
seriously, then added boyishly, with a glance that
took her in, as well as the scenery: "Just now,
I don't care if I never go home!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>A TIP</h3>


<p>For the next few days the girls took possession
of Allen, showing him the sights with a will
and showering him with details of their adventures
till the poor fellow's head was in a whirl
and he could hardly tell whether it was the wolves
or the landslide that had frightened the girls into
the cave on that memorable afternoon.</p>

<p>"Seems to me," he said, as the girls showed him
the cave&mdash;at a safe distance from the mountain,
one may be sure&mdash;"that you young ladies need a
chaperone pretty badly."</p>

<p>"Do you think you're it?" teased Mollie.</p>

<p>"Great guns! I should hope not," said Allen,
with a flash of his white teeth. "I would rather
face a dugout full of Boches than try to keep
tabs on you girls. See here," he added, suddenly
serious. "Do you mean to tell me that you were
really caught in that cave with your horses and
nothing to dig your way out with but your
hands?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"And a few sharp stones that we found,"
Betty nodded soberly.</p>

<p>Allen whistled softly.</p>

<p>"No, I should think not," he said slowly. "It's
a wonder that with you and your horses, too, in
that small space, you didn't smother before aid
could reach you."</p>

<p>"We should have," spoke up Amy quickly, "if
it hadn't been for Betty. She was the one who
kept us at it when we were ready to give up."</p>

<p>"Yes, and she was the one that kept at it when
the rest of us <i>had</i> given up," Mollie reminded
her. "She was the one who kept digging until
she forced the hole through. If it hadn't been
for her we would have all given up and just died
there, I guess."</p>

<p>Betty, who had been getting redder and redder
through this recital of her heroism, found it hard
to meet Allen's eyes as he turned to her with all
his heart in his own.</p>

<p>"The girls give me altogether too much credit,"
she protested. "Anybody will fight when he has
his back against the wall. And now let's take Allen
to see Dan Higgins' mine," she added lightly.
"Dan Higgins and his daughter Meggy are great
friends of ours, Allen, and I know you will love
them as much as we do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your friends will always be mine," Allen assured
her gallantly, and they rode off gayly toward
Gold Run.</p>

<p>On the way they told him a good deal of Dan
Higgins and Meggy, and Allen listened with sympathetic
interest.</p>

<p>"That surely is tough," he said boyishly. "But
of course his case is no different from that of
hundreds of others who have come out here to
'God's Country' in the hope of beating the daily
grind and jumping to fortune at one fell swoop.
That sounds rather Irish, doesn't it?" he added,
with his contagious grin.</p>

<p>"You're right about that, I suppose," said Betty
gravely. "As you say, Dan Higgins is just one
of a hundred others in the same pitiful fix. But
at least he has had his dreams and the excitement
of gambling. He chose this sort of life, and so
we don't feel so awfully sorry for him. But it
is his daughter Meggy that we pity. She is
really a wonderful girl, Allen, and to condemn
her to a life of work and poverty is really a
crime."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't do it," said Allen plaintively,
adding quickly as Betty's face clouded: "I beg
your pardon, little girl, I didn't mean to be flippant.
But, like her father, there are many others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in the position of this girl. A man can't choose
to live a life like that without dragging his family
into it too."</p>

<p>"Then he shouldn't have a family," said Mollie
hotly. "He should make up his mind to be
an old bachelor&mdash;though I don't think there is
anything worse under the sun," she added, with
such emphasis that the girls giggled.</p>

<p>"I agree with you there," said Allen, adding
whimsically: "But what a man should do and
what he does do are often very different things."</p>

<p>"But you speak of Dan Higgins and Meggy as
if they were just ordinary people," Grace objected,
as she flicked the reins gently on Nabob's
arching neck. "You seem to forget that they
saved our lives&mdash;probably."</p>

<p>"No, I don't forget that," said Allen gravely.
"And I respect your wish to do something in
return. I also owe them a debt of gratitude."
His eyes unconsciously sought Betty's, and a
quick glance passed between them that was more
eloquent than words.</p>

<p>"Then you will help us to help him?" said
Betty quickly.</p>

<p>"I'll do anything I can," Allen answered, adding,
rather dubiously: "But I don't see what any
one can do for them. If the old man hasn't
struck gold yet and is short of funds to finance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
further search, I don't see what any one can do
for him. Do you?" he added, looking at her.</p>

<p>"No-o," admitted Betty reluctantly. "I
haven't thought of a way yet. But I'm sure I
shall," she added so bravely that the girls wanted
to hug her.</p>

<p>They reached the Higgins' mine soon after
this, and at the sound of their approach Meggy
ran eagerly out to them, as she always did. But
when she saw Allen, looking to her unsophisticated
eyes like some hero out of a story book,
handsome and city-bred, she halted and turned
red with embarrassment.</p>

<p>However, Allen, by his own gracious and
friendly manner, soon set her at ease, but her eyes
continued to follow every movement of his as
though in amazement that such a perfect creature
could live.</p>

<p>"Better look out, Betty," Grace whispered to
the Little Captain when nobody was looking.
"Meggy thinks Allen is pretty nice. Just watch
her, she's hypnotized."</p>

<p>But Betty only smiled. Somehow, she felt
pretty sure of Allen.</p>

<p>The latter struck up a great friendship with old
Dan Higgins right away&mdash;wonderful how everybody
took to Allen, thought Betty proudly&mdash;and
soon they were talking like old friends. In five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
minutes Allen had found out more about Dan
Higgins' mine and his prospects than the girls
would have learned in a year.</p>

<p>Toward the end Allen managed to put a few
adroit questions concerning Gold Run Ranch and
the possibility of there being gold upon it.</p>

<p>"Waal now," drawled Higgins, spitting upon
the ground reflectively, "folks here'bouts used to
wonder why old Jed Barcolm didn't get busy
and find out if there was gold on thet property,
but somehow th' old man never seemed to get
interested. Conservative old fellow, Jed Barcolm,
anyways&mdash;allus said he'd made enough
raisin' cattle and didn't aim to do no prospectin'
at his time o' life."</p>

<p>"But you think there is a good possibility of
there being gold on the ranch?" insisted Allen,
and the girls held their breath.</p>

<p>Dan Higgins gave him a shrewd look and spat
once more.</p>

<p>"You thinkin' of doin' a little prospectin' on
your own hook, Son?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Heavens, no!" answered Allen with convincing
sincerity, adding with a smile: "It is barely
possible that my client might, though."</p>

<p>The old man started and stood upright, squaring
his thin shoulders belligerently.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me you're one o' those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
ornery lawyer cusses," he said, with a disgusted
emphasis that angered the girls but apparently
left Allen unmoved.</p>

<p>"A lawyer&mdash;but not ornery, I hope," he said
pleasantly. "And my client is Mrs. Nelson, the
new owner of the ranch. Is there anything else
you would like to know about me?"</p>

<p>But the old man's anger had departed and he
regarded Allen with a shrewd twinkle in his
kindly blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Son," he said. "I reckon there are
some honest lawyers, though I never ain't met
one yet&mdash;not round here leastways."</p>

<p>"Thanks for a rather doubtful compliment,"
laughed Allen. It was evident that he was enjoying
the old man extremely. "I assure you,
though I am not always honest, there are times
when I try very hard to be." Then he suddenly
added: "By the way, do you happen to know a
man around here&mdash;one of those ornery lawyers&mdash;by
the name of Peter Levine?"</p>

<p>Again Dan Higgins spat disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Know him!" he answered with a wealth of
scorn in his voice. "I reckon most everybody
round here knows him&mdash;an' they's mighty few
knows any good o' him. Take my advice, Son,
an' keep away from him."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Allen dryly. "But the problem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
seems to be to keep him away from us. He is
representing a client who wants to buy Gold Run
Ranch."</p>

<p>The old man started and a gleam of excitement
shot into his eyes while Meggy, seeming to share
his emotion, crept closer to him.</p>

<p>"Peter Levine wants you to sell," he repeated
eagerly, then relaxed once more into his drawl,
though his eyes reflected a strange inward turmoil.
"Listen, Son," he said. "Ef you let that
snake in the grass argy you into sellin', you're
a bigger fool 'n I take you to be. An' what's
more," his voice lowered and the girls leaned
forward eagerly, "if Peter wants that there property
of yourn there's gold on it, you can bet
your last dollar onto it. Pete ain't no angel, an'
he don't work for nothing."</p>

<p>Burning with excitement themselves, the girls
marveled that Allen could take this statement so
calmly.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the tip," he said, in his ordinary
voice. "I had some such idea myself, but it certainly
helps to have my judgment backed by somebody
who knows the people in the case."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE NET TIGHTENS</h3>


<p>Allen learned much about Peter Levine and
his associates and about Gold Run itself in the
following conversation, and when he and the
girls finally said good-by to the old man and
his daughter and started off down the trail again,
he was more than satisfied.</p>

<p>As for the girls, they could hardly wait to get
out of earshot of the mine before letting loose
a flood of excited comment.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see anything to get so excited
about," said Allen, after they had rattled on for
several minutes. "Dan Higgins didn't tell us
anything we didn't already know&mdash;or suspect,
anyway. He simply confirmed our suspicions,
that's all."</p>

<p>"Seems to me that's enough," retorted Mollie.
"It's one thing to think a thing yourself and an
entirely different thing to find out somebody else
thinks it too."</p>

<p>"Don't be an old granddaddy, Allen," Betty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
said, adding threateningly: "If you don't look out
we won't let you have any of that wonderful gold
we are going to find&mdash;not one little tiny nugget."</p>

<p>"That's gratitude for you," said Allen reproachfully.
"Not one little nugget for a fellow who
finds her a fortune."</p>

<p>"You haven't found it yet," Amy reminded
him.</p>

<p>"No," said Allen suddenly animated, "I haven't
found it&mdash;not yet&mdash;but I'm pretty sure I'm on
the right track. Look here," he appealed to
them: "It seems reasonable to me to suppose
that if Peter Levine and the people above him
are so anxious to get the property they know
pretty well where they stand. They don't want
the ranch simply because they <i>think</i> there is gold
on it."</p>

<p>"Then you think&mdash;&mdash;" Betty was beginning
breathlessly, when Allen interrupted her with a
rush of words.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just what I think," he said. "I've
been pretty well over the whole of this ranch
since I came, and I've noticed that this extreme
northwest portion of it, the only part where there
would be any possibility of finding gold, is pretty
well deserted most of the time&mdash;absolutely so at
night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you think," Betty burst forth, "that these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
people, whoever they are, may have made actual
tests? That they are sure there is gold here?"</p>

<p>Allen nodded.</p>

<p>"That is my theory," he said gravely. "But
of course the only way to prove the truth of it
is to keep my eyes open and catch them, if that
is possible, in the act."</p>

<p>"But how could one conceal such a thing?"
Grace objected. "A big thing like a mine can't
be hidden away in the daytime like a rag doll.
There must be some signs about the place to show
that people have been here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Allen. "There probably are
signs&mdash;only nobody has had the incentive&mdash;or the
interest, maybe&mdash;to hunt for those signs up to this
time. Although," he added thoughtfully, "there
are many ways of camouflaging the entrance to
a mine so that a casual observer, even an interested
one, possibly, would be fooled&mdash;branches,
leaves, a rock or two."</p>

<p>"But wouldn't there be noise?" It was Amy
who put the objection this time. "I should
think they would make enough disturbance to
rouse suspicion at least."</p>

<p>"They might not," Allen contended. "Remember,
they are right in the mining territory,
so that if any of the miners heard an unusual
noise they would think it was one of their neigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>bors
working late. Anyway," he finished, "their
operations would necessarily have to be small, and
they might be so small as not even to arouse suspicion.
Sometimes," he added, and the girls hung
on his words as though they were prophetic,
"there need be no actual digging to ascertain
that there is gold in a certain region. Sometimes
the bed of a spring if sifted to get rid of pebbles
and other d&eacute;bris will reveal gold enough to make
the finder certain that there is a rich gold vein
close by."</p>

<p>"Goodness, let's go and hunt up some springs!"
cried Mollie irrepressibly. "What's the use of
leaving all this gold finding to Mr. Peter Levine?"</p>

<p>"I remember seeing an old broken sieve around
the ranch house somewhere," Grace suggested
helpfully. "Don't you suppose we can go back
and get it?"</p>

<p>"But, Allen," Betty asked anxiously, "how do
you expect to find out about these men? I suppose
you intend to show them up?"</p>

<p>"I most certainly do," responded Allen cheerfully.
"It would give me the greatest delight to
land Mr. Peter Levine and his associates in jail."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better look out you don't get
landed yourself," said Mollie sagely. "I imagine
these particular gentlemen are pretty handy with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
their guns&mdash;like most of the other people around
here&mdash;and I reckon they wouldn't be very backward
about using them."</p>

<p>"It would be fifty-fifty, at that," said Allen,
adding grimly: "I'm not so very unhandy with
a gun myself. But the war's over and I haven't
any idea of staging a tragedy," he added lightly,
anxious to banish the cloud that had come over
Betty's bright face. "I shall keep out of sight till
I have them just where I want them, and when
they find themselves caught I don't think they'll
do much fighting. All crooks are more or less
cowards, you know."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do in the meantime&mdash;while
you are waiting for a chance to
show them up?" Betty persisted. She did not
half like the way things were going&mdash;even if
there was a chance of finding a fortune on the
ranch. It seemed to her that Allen was putting
himself into too great danger. And if anything
happened to him, what would all the gold in the
world be worth?</p>

<p>"'In the meantime?'" Allen was answering her
question lightly. "Why, in the meantime I intend
to keep my eyes and ears wide open and do
a little scouting around Gold Run until I get a
line on the doings of Peter Levine and his crowd&mdash;if
he has a crowd. He may just be in part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>nership
with one other rascal like himself, for
all I know. That's one of the first things I want
to find out. After the information of our friend,
back there at the mine," he added, "there is no
longer any doubt in my mind that this Levine is
a crook."</p>

<p>"Humph," said Betty, "I was sure of that the
first time I laid eyes on him."</p>

<p>"And yet you said you could almost love him
for making your mother decide to come out here,"
Allen reminded her quizzically.</p>

<p>"And you said you were on your way to kill
him," said Betty, adding with a chuckle: "What
made you change your mind?"</p>

<p>"I didn't change my mind," retorted Allen,
with a grin. "I just didn't happen to meet him,
that's all."</p>

<p>They had nearly reached the ranch house before
Betty thought to ask Allen if he had talked
his plans over with her mother.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," he admitted. "As a matter
of fact, I hadn't made any definite plans until I
had this confab with Dan Higgins. He made
me see the whole thing straight, so to speak. I'll
have a talk with your mother and father to-night,"
he promised.</p>

<p>He kept his promise and had the satisfaction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
knowing that both his clients were backing him
heartily.</p>

<p>"Go to it, Allen," Mr. Nelson said at the end of
the conference. "Seems to me that you have
gotten the correct angle on this thing, and if
you need any help from me just call on me.
Only," he warned, "don't run yourself into unnecessary
trouble."</p>

<p>"I've found, sir," said Allen, with that straight-forward
look that made every one like and admire
him, "that it's usually the fellow who runs away
from trouble who gets the most of it. I'm not
worrying about that end of the business."</p>

<p>But if he did not worry, Betty certainly did in
the days that followed. She had dreams at
night in which she saw Allen riding about in the
shadows. There would be a report, two reports,
and he would topple over backwards to lie
crumpled up and motionless. No wonder that
she became pale and lost her appetite and made
her mother worry even in the midst of the excitement
over this double hunt&mdash;the hunt for men and
gold.</p>

<p>One night after dinner Allen asked her to ride
with him a little way, said it would do him a
lot of good just to talk to her. Betty agreed,
and they cantered off in the twilight, their bodies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
swaying to the rhythm of the beautiful animals
under them.</p>

<p>For a long time they were silent, just enjoying
the rapid motion, the sweet scented air that
fanned their faces, the beauty of the hazy mountains
in the distance. Then, suddenly Allen
spoke.</p>

<p>"Betty," he said, swinging round toward her,
"you aren't letting this thing get on your nerves,
are you?"</p>

<p>"Wh-what do you mean?" she asked faintly.
"What thing?"</p>

<p>"This gold business&mdash;the excitement of it all,"
he said, waving his hand largely as though to take
in the whole landscape. "I've noticed you
looked tired lately," he went on gently, "and I've
worried about it, little Betty. I&mdash;I have almost
dared to hope," he leaned toward her, but Betty
was looking the other way, "that you were a
little anxious about me. Were you?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I&mdash;yes&mdash;no&mdash;why&mdash;I don't know,"
cried Betty wildly, then, meeting his eye, she
laughed, a twinkling little laugh. "You shouldn't
ask questions like that, not so suddenly, anyway,"
she said primly. "It isn't fair."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I got my answer," said Allen
jubilantly, and again Betty found it a little hard
to look at him. "You mustn't worry though,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
little girl," he went on gently. "There isn't any
danger&mdash;really. I'm just playing a delightful
little game&mdash;and I'm going to win. Went to see
Levine to-day, representing your mother," he
added, and his tone suddenly became grim. "He
made me feel, or at least he tried to make me
feel, that he had as much respect for my ability
as he would for a little speck of dirt."</p>

<p>"The very idea!" cried Betty indignantly. "I'd
just like to tell him what I think of&mdash;your ability&mdash;&mdash;"
she faltered on these last words, for
Allen was gazing at her with a most disconcerting
light in his eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly she whirled Nigger's head about and
urged him to a gallop.</p>

<p>"Race you home, Allen!" she challenged.
"Winner <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'get's'">gets</ins> the other fellow's piece of cake."</p>

<p>"Who cares for cake!" cried Allen, but it
might have been noticed that he followed her
just the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>IN THE SHADOWS</h3>


<p>Allen was acting in two capacities at this
time&mdash;that of lawyer and that of private detective.
He probably would not have taken this
r&ocirc;le for anybody but Betty and her family, but
in order to serve them he was willing to do
pretty nearly anything.</p>

<p>So he had taken to scouting around the northern
end of the ranch after dark, in the hope that
he might possibly discover something that would
help him in his theory that there was really gold
on the ranch and, also, that Peter Levine and
his cronies, whoever they were, knew of it.</p>

<p>However, as the days passed, bringing no new
developments, the young fellow began to think
that he had let his imagination run away with
him. He even began to formulate plans by which
he could lure the unsuspecting Peter Levine into
telling what he knew.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;just when he was beginning to
despair of being any help at all to Betty and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
family&mdash;fate or luck, or whatever one wishes to
call it, chose to smile upon him once more.</p>

<p>He was prowling around when quite unexpectedly
he found himself confronted by Andy
Rawlinson. He had struck up quite a liking for
the head cowboy, and the two walked along together.</p>

<p>Gradually they neared a patch of timber near
the northern boundary of the ranch. The cowboy
said he was looking for two calves that had
strayed away.</p>

<p>"And it ain't no use to follow 'em into the
woods on hossback," he explained.</p>

<p>"I have an object in coming here," declared
Allen, at last. "I am watching out for Peter
Levine." He felt he could trust Rawlinson.</p>

<p>"I thought as much," replied the head cowboy,
with a chuckle. "Believe me, I wouldn't trust
Levine out o' my sight, if I was the boss. I've
seen him prowlin' around here several times."</p>

<p>"Then you think he has some secret motive in
getting hold of the ranch?"</p>

<p>"Sure as shootin'. That feller is a bad one&mdash;take
it from me."</p>

<p>"Please don't make too much noise around
here," went on Allen. "I was thinking he might
come again in the dark some night&mdash;to do a little
prospecting, or something like that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"I get you. It would be just like him. Quiet
it is." And after that the pair spoke only in
whispers.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen of the calves, and presently
Rawlinson was on the point of going back, when,
all at once, something occurred to make him remain.</p>

<p>The night was intensely dark; not a star
twinkled through the storm clouds that scudded
across the sky. Allen had just stubbed his toe
on a projecting root and had muttered something
uncomplimentary to the darkness of the night
when an unusual sound caught the ears of the
two young men and stopped them dead in their
tracks.</p>

<p>Some one was coming through the brush.
Some one, like Allen, had stumbled and was muttering
under his breath.</p>

<p>"Shut up, can't you?" a second voice growled,
and Allen's hand instinctively went to Rawlinson's
arm to quiet him.</p>

<p>"Two of them," he thought exultantly, as he
held himself and the cowboy against the trunk
of a tree. "There may be some action after
all."</p>

<p>The two strangers passed close enough to Allen
and Rawlinson to have touched them. But
they did not notice the young men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Allen and the cowboy, their blood tingling with
excitement, followed the pair, and when, some
hundred yards on, the strangers stopped, they
stopped too, keeping within the shadow of the
trees.</p>

<p>The strangers were bending over some sort of
paper which they were examining by the light
of an electric torch.</p>

<p>"Here's the place, Jim," one of the men said,
pointing first to the paper and then into the
shadow of the woods. "There's gold running
wild around here, man. I've tested the bed of
the creek that runs down there, and it's chock
full of yellow men. Why, if we can get hold
of this ranch we're rich men&mdash;rich over night, I
tell you!"</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted the other, noncommittally.
"How are you goin' to get hold of this ranch?
Ain't done it yet, so's any one could notice it."</p>

<p>"No, that's where you come in, Jim," replied
the other, and as he turned eagerly to his companion
Allen and Rawlinson recognized the features
of Peter Levine. "This woman, this Mrs.
Nelson who owns the place, won't sell. I'm
afraid she may have an idea that there's gold
here. And she suspects me, for some reason."</p>

<p>The other man laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"'Tain't hard for most of us to guess the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
reason for that, Pete." And at the sneer Levine
gave a grunt.</p>

<p>"You must have your little joke, Jim," he said.
"But now let's get down to business. The woman
distrusts me and she has sent for this insolent
cub lawyer&mdash;Washburn, his name is. He's
been to see me already, the unwhipped pup," he
went on, while in the shadows Allen's hands gripped
themselves into fists, "trying to find out more
about my client and John Josephs. Say, that's
a good joke, Jim. Here they are after that
imaginary ranchman, John Josephs, and my client
who they think are crooks, when all the time
little Peter Levine is their meat and they don't
know it."</p>

<p>"You didn't let on you wuz the one that wanted
the place?" questioned Jim, who was evidently
able to appreciate this joke. "You wuz just the
lawyer, and so nowise interested except jest in
the fee?"</p>

<p>"Righto!" chuckled the other. "And a good-sized
fee it will be if once I can get my hands
on it."</p>

<p>"Which you ain't&mdash;yet," the other reminded
him. "Get busy, Pete, and tell us your scheme.
I don't want to be standin' around here all night."
He gave an uneasy glance over his shoulder, and
Allen and Rawlinson shrank still further into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
shadows. They were not yet ready to make their
presence known.</p>

<p>"All right," said Peter Levine, speaking hurriedly.
"If you'll agree to my suggestion, you're
in for easy money, Jim. All you have to do is
to approach this Mrs. Nelson and make her an
offer for the ranch&mdash;for yourself, you understand.
She doesn't know you, and she may have
become tired of mooning around here by now,
and there's just a chance that she'll take you&mdash;that
is, if you handle the cards right. No eagerness,
you understand&mdash;just sort of offhand and
careless, as if you didn't care much whether she
took you or not."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said the other, with his noncommittal
grunt. "Sounds easy, don't it? But what do I
get out of it, ef I pull this deal off, eh?"</p>

<p>"Half of all the gold we find, Jim," said the
other, waving his hand largely. "You'll never regret
it if you put this thing through. You'll be
a rich man."</p>

<p>"All right, I'm on," said Jim.</p>

<p>"Then I guess it's about time we got back,"
returned Peter Levine, and the two men moved
as if to leave that vicinity.</p>

<p>"We don't want them to get away," Allen whispered
excitedly to Rawlinson. "I want to get
hold of that paper if possible."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon that will be easy, Washburn," returned
the head cowboy. "I'm armed, you know,
and I'll take my chances against those two rascals
any time. Just follow me."</p>

<p>Without waiting for Allen to reply to this,
Andy Rawlinson ran forward swiftly and silently,
and in a few seconds had confronted the
rascally pair. He had drawn his pistol, but he
did not raise the weapon.</p>

<p>"Halt, both of you!" he cried, sharply. "Hands
up there!"</p>

<p>"Hi! what's the meaning of this?" cried Levine,
in astonishment. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"It's Rawlinson, the head man here," muttered
the man called Jim.</p>

<p>"Right!" answered the cowboy. "And here
is a particular friend of yours, Levine," he added,
as Allen stepped closer.</p>

<p>"Washburn!" muttered the rascally lawyer
from Gold Run. And then he added quickly:
"Have you been spying on us?"</p>

<p>"If we have, that's our affair," answered Allen
coolly. "You'd better keep those hands up," he
went on quickly, as he saw the two rascals making
a move as if to start something.</p>

<p>"They'll keep 'em up all right enough," broke
in Rawlinson. "I reckon you know me," he went
on sternly. "And I'll stand for no foolin'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"We haven't been doing anything wrong,"
came from Levine, lamely.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Of course not!" said Allen sarcastically.
"Only trying to get hold of a bonanza for
next to nothing!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Washburn," came from the
head cowboy. "Just relieve 'em of their weapons
first. Then maybe we'll be able to talk with
more satisfaction."</p>

<p>With Rawlinson confronting them, Levine and
his companion did not dare offer any resistance,
and quickly Allen took their weapons from them
and handed the firearms to Rawlinson.</p>

<p>"Now I'll thank you, Levine, for that paper
you were examining so carefully just a few minutes
ago," went on the young lawyer.</p>

<p>"This is robbery!" fumed Peter Levine. "I'll
have you before the courts for this."</p>

<p>Allen eyed him steadily.</p>

<p>"Do you represent the law in this place?" he
asked. "If so, I am sorry for the inhabitants.
But there is no use in prolonging this discussion,
Levine. I want that paper. Hand it over at
once."</p>

<p>The rascally lawyer from Gold Run attempted
to argue, but the sight of Rawlinson's weapon
subdued him, and presently he handed over the
crumpled sheet, which Allen seized with much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
satisfaction. During this transaction Jim remained
sullenly silent.</p>

<p>"Now I guess that's about all," said Allen to
the cowboy.</p>

<p>"If that's the case I guess we can bid you
skunks good-evening," came quickly from Rawlinson.
"Both of you beat it. And don't ever
let me ketch you around here again."</p>

<p>"What about my gun?" came feebly from
Jim.</p>

<p>"I'll send the guns over to Levine's office to-morrow,"
answered the head cowboy. "Now
clear out, and be quick about it." And a moment
later the two rascals stumbled away through
the darkness.</p>

<p>"This is certainly what I call luck," cried Allen
excitedly, as he gazed at the scrap of paper
Levine had passed over. "Rawlinson, you have
certainly helped me do a good night's work.
If what that scoundrel said is true, this will
mean a fortune for Betty and her mother."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I chanced along, Washburn," answered
the head cowboy. "After this I think
I'll set a guard. If it leaks out that there is
gold on this ranch there will be all sorts of fellows
beside those skunks trying to locate claims
around here."</p>

<p>"Will you go up to the house with me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. I'll stick around here a while and see
if those fellows come back. Besides, I want to
see if I can get any trace of those strayed-away
calves. You go ahead. You can tell me about
it later. You can take their guns with you if
you will."</p>

<p>Half running, half stumbling, in his eagerness,
Allen reached the house, took the steps of the
porch three at a time, and burst into the big
homelike kitchen, where he found the family
assembled.</p>

<p>"We've got 'em, folks!" he cried, waving the
scrap of paper over his head, while they stared
at him as though they thought he had gone mad.
"I've been out hunting and brought home a prize.
Come look at it."</p>

<p>He went over to the table beside which Mr.
and Mrs. Nelson were sitting and laid the two
captured pistols upon the table. Infected by his
excitement, the girls crowded around, demanding
an explanation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 261px;">

<span class="caption">THE GIRLS CROWDED AROUND, DEMANDING AN EXPLANATION.</span>
</div>

<div class='center'><i>The Outdoor Girls in the Saddle.</i> <i>Page 163</i></div>

<p>"Pistols!" cried Betty, her eyes wide with dislike
of the things. "Where did you get them,
Allen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just picked them off the trees by the
roadside," said Allen airily. Then, suddenly becoming
serious, he laid the scrap of paper beside
the weapons on the table. "There," he said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
dramatically, "is the key that may open your door
to a fortune."</p>

<p>"A map," said Mrs. Nelson, her eyes glistening.
"Oh, Allen, you've found out something
wonderful. Tell us about it, please."</p>

<p>And so Allen recounted what had taken place
during that fruitful half hour in the shadows of
the trees. His audience listened breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Then this thing," said Mr. Nelson, taking the
bit of paper which was crossed and criss-crossed
with a number of lines and dotted with numbers
until it seemed more like a jig-saw puzzle than
a map, "is supposedly a map which will point
out the probable location of gold."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Allen.</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Nelson, feeling the thrill of
adventure in his own blood, "we'll begin to look
for this gold to-morrow. That is&mdash;" He paused
and looked quizzically about at the group of tense
young faces. "If everybody is willing."</p>

<p>"Oh-h," was all that they could say&mdash;just then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE NEW MINE</h3>


<p>The next day much excitement filled the
ranch house. Betty declared that she had not
slept a wink the night before, worrying for fear
her father had not meant what he said.</p>

<p>But Mr. Nelson had meant what he had said,
and there was Mrs. Nelson as eager as the girls
to keep him to his word.</p>

<p>"The ranch is mine, you know," she laughingly
reminded the girls. "And if there are gold
mines on it I certainly intend to find them."</p>

<p>It was settled, and Mr. Nelson and Allen set
out for town to make arrangements for the enterprise.
The girls wanted to go too, but Mr.
Nelson pointed out that he and Allen could probably
do the work more quickly if they were alone,
and it was upon this point and this point only that
the girls consented to let them go.</p>

<p>"But that needn't keep us from the saddle,"
Mollie decided, as they watched the two men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>canter swiftly away. "I don't know about
the rest of you, but I'm just longing for
action."</p>

<p>"Ditto," cried Betty, then added with bright
eagerness: "Girls, I know what we can do! Let's
go down to the place where Allen found those
two men last night. That's where the mines are,
you know, and we might stake out claims or
something."</p>

<p>"Your mother might have something to say
to that," said Grace, making a funny face.
"It isn't quite the thing to stake out claims on
somebody else's property."</p>

<p>"Oh well, you needn't be so particular," cried
Betty airily. "Come on, girls, who's with me?"</p>

<p>It seemed they all were, and, fairly dancing
with excitement, they made their way to the corrals
where Andy Rawlinson saddled their horses
for them.</p>

<p>The horses seemed to catch some of the girls'
excitement, and it was all that the latter could do
to hold the animals in.</p>

<p>"It must be in the air," laughed Grace, as she
pulled in Nabob sharply. "We've all got the
gold fever."</p>

<p>"Let's give them their heads," said Mollie suddenly.
"I'd like a regular gallop this morning."</p>

<p>"All right, let's go," sang out Betty, and in another
minute they were off, the horses galloping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
like mad and the girls laughing and shouting in
utter abandonment to their high spirits.</p>

<p>At this rate it took them only a few minutes
to reach the spot where Allen had had his adventure
the night before.</p>

<p>They reined in sharply, and Betty jumped
down, throwing the reins over Nigger's neck and
giving him a fond little pat on the flank.</p>

<p>"There, old boy," she said. "Go and eat some
grass for yourself while we do a little prospecting.
Girls," she added as they in turn dismounted
and ran up to her, "from Allen's description,
it must have been just about here that he
stood." She indicated the bent tree with the
great bowlder behind it that Allen had described
to them. "And the two men must have stood
in there among that heavy shrubbery somewhere."</p>

<p>"Then this is where they will begin work,"
cried Amy, a faint flush warming her face. "Oh,
Betty, it all seems like a fairy story."</p>

<p>"Fairy story, nothing!" exclaimed Mollie.
"This is a real, honest-to-goodness adventure
story. My, it's a wonder Allen didn't get shot
up last night," she added thoughtfully. "It must
have taken nerve to stand here, listening to those
old scoundrels and not knowing what minute
they might find him out and fire upon him."</p>

<p>"I think Allen is perfectly wonderful, anyway,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
said Grace, and Betty thrilled at the tribute. "He
never seems to know what it is to be afraid. And
he always gets what he wants, too."</p>

<p>"And to think that 'John Josephs' never existed!"
chuckled Betty. "Peter Levine must have
quite a good deal of imagination."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the use of standing here?" said
Amy, after a moment of silent musing. "Let's
look around a little bit and see what we can see."</p>

<p>So for a while they thrashed around in the
bush, accomplishing very little besides scaring
some rabbits and woodchucks into their holes.
They found the tiny creek Peter Levine had
spoken of, and they gazed with interest at its
muddy, sluggish water.</p>

<p>"Who would ever think there was gold in the
bottom of that?" whispered Mollie.</p>

<p>When they finally became convinced that there
was nothing more to be seen they started reluctantly
home again.</p>

<p>"Let's go around by the mine and see how
Meggy and her dad are coming on," suggested
Betty, and so they changed their course a little
to include the mine.</p>

<p>Meggy was glad to see them as usual but they
could tell by the weariness of her bearing that
there was no good news as far as she was con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>cerned
and they had not the heart to tell her their
own.</p>

<p>"Can't you come over to the ranch for a little
while?" asked Betty, eager to do some little thing
toward cheering the girl. But Meggy shook her
head.</p>

<p>"I can't leave father&mdash;even for a little while,"
she said sadly. "He ain't feeling well, and I'm
afraid if his luck doesn't change pretty soon I&mdash;I&mdash;won't
have any dad&mdash;&mdash;" she choked and
turned away. Betty was beside her in a moment,
her arm about the girl's shoulders.</p>

<p>"We're awfully sorry, honey," she said compassionately.
"We didn't know that your father
was feeling bad. Is he&mdash;is he really sick?"</p>

<p>"Sick of life, I guess," said Meggy, conquering
her emotion and instantly ashamed of it.
"I've heered of people dyin' of a broken heart,
an' that's what dad's doin', I guess. Bad luck
can kill you if it keeps up long enough."</p>

<p>The girls rode home saddened by this brief
encounter. It seemed almost wrong for them to
be happy when Dan Higgins was "dyin' of a
broken heart" and Meggy, brave, splendid girl
that she was, had almost lost hope.</p>

<p>"If only everybody in the world could be
happy," said Grace plaintively. "It just spoils<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
all your fun when you know that other people
are miserable."</p>

<p>"The worst of it is," said Betty soberly, "that
with all this luck coming our way we can't pass
on a single little bit of it to that poor girl and her
dad. If only they weren't so proud&mdash;&mdash;" The
sentence trailed off into a sigh, and she gazed
pensively out over the plain.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no use of crying over it," said
Mollie briskly. "We may find a way of being
useful to Meggy yet, and until then, as my mother
says, 'let's be canty with thinking about it.' Oh,
look, girls, here comes Allen. I wonder what
kind of news he has."</p>

<p>They galloped gayly to meet him, and Allen
thought they made a very pretty picture as they
swept up to him.</p>

<p>"Well," he said as they surrounded him, "everything
is settled and they are to begin work to-morrow
morning. Our news has aroused great
excitement in town, and there's a rush to establish
claims near that end of our ranch. Better
give your friend, Dan Higgins, a hint, so that he
can get in first. So long. I'm on to the house
for the map, and then I'm going to join Mr. Nelson
again in town."</p>

<p>So he dashed off in the direction of the ranch
and the girls wheeled and galloped back in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
direction they had come&mdash;back toward Dan Higgins'
mine to warn him to stake a new claim
before others reached the spot.</p>

<p>They were so excited that it was hard to make
their purpose clear at first, but when the old man
and Meggy comprehended what they were trying
to tell them, they were immediately galvanized
to action.</p>

<p>"I'll show you the best place," Betty eagerly
volunteered.</p>

<p>Mollie offered to stay behind and give the
old man her horse, and in a minute Betty and
Dan Higgins were galloping over the plain to that
part of the ranch where the new gold mines were
to be. They had not far to go, and they saw
with relief that they were the first on the spot.</p>

<p>Betty pointed out the place where Peter Levine
had said there was gold running wild, and old
Dan Higgins staked his claim as near to the place
as he could without actually encroaching upon
the ranch itself.</p>

<p>With trembling fingers he printed on two big
placards the exact dimensions of his claim, and,
with Betty's help, nailed them to two trees at the
two extreme ends of his new property, and began
to dig.</p>

<p>"Thar," he sighed, after a few moments, taking
off his hat to mop the perspiration from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
forehead, "I've made another bargain with luck,
an' mebbe this time I'll win."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you will," cried Betty, with conviction.
"If there is gold on our ranch, and we are
sure there is, then there is almost certain to be
some on your property also. Oh, Mr. Dan Higgins,
I so dearly hope that there is!" This was so
evidently a cry straight from her earnest young
heart that the keen eyes of the hardened old miner
filled with tears and he patted Betty's head with
an unsteady hand.</p>

<p>"You're a mighty fine little gal," he said finally.
"Ef an old man's gratitude means anything to
you, you sure have got it. I've a sort of sure
feelin' you've changed the luck for Meggy and
me."</p>

<p>They were silent on the ride back to the mine,
but as they reached the last stretch of the trail
that led down to it the old man shifted in his
saddle and looked at Betty earnestly.</p>

<p>"An' ef Meggy's mother was alive," he said
simply, "she would thank you, too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>THE VIOLINIST AGAIN</h3>


<p>As Allen had predicted, there was a general
rush on the part of the miners to establish claims
on the property adjoining the ranch, and the girls
congratulated themselves over and over again
that they had reached Dan Higgins with the glad
tidings in time for him to secure the best location.</p>

<p>All day long the girls were in the saddle, hovering
about the new gold diggings, fascinated at
the way new mines seemed to spring up over
night.</p>

<p>Next to those on their own property, they were
most interested in Dan Higgins' mine and in their
hearts they would really rather have had him find
gold than to find it themselves.</p>

<p>"They need it so much more than we do,"
Betty said anxiously. "If Dan Higgins and
Meggy have drawn another blank I don't know
what they will do."</p>

<p>In the midst of all this confusion and excite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>ment,
Amy received the program of the benefit
concert given at the Hostess House for which
she had sent home some time before. They had
almost forgotten the hermit and it was with a
shock of surprise that they remembered they had
not seen him since the new mining operations.
Before that they had run across him quite often
attempting to help Meggy and Dan in his rather
eccentric way.</p>

<p>"Guess he must have been scared off by the
crowd," said Mollie. "Too much excitement for
the old boy."</p>

<p>The four of them were sitting on the large
front porch of the house, still in their riding
habits, while their horses, at the foot of the
steps, stamped their impatience to be off again.
Nothing but the arrival of the mail could have
drawn the girls from the fascination of the new
gold diggings. They hardly took time to eat;
and as for sleep, well, they took that in between
times!</p>

<p>Now Grace called to Amy, making room on
the step beside her.</p>

<p>"Come over here and show us your program,"
she said, extracting a bit of candy from some
hidden recess somewhere about her person and
popping it into her mouth. "I'm anxious to see
what that violinist's name was."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Amy obeyed, and as Grace opened the program
Mollie and Betty drew closer and peeped over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Concerto&mdash;Liszt," read Grace, her finger pointing
down the page. "No, that isn't it. That's
for the piano. Hold on, here we are. Chopin&mdash;Nocturne&mdash;Paul
Loup, violinist. There he is.
Now will you please tell me how that helps us
to find out anything about the hermit?" She
paused with her finger still pointing to the name
and looked up at them inquiringly.</p>

<p>"We-el," said Betty thoughtfully, "it doesn't
help very much, I must admit. It doesn't prove
that Paul Loup is our Hermit of Gold Run. Only
that funny feeling I have of having seen him
before and heard him play&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you what we'll do!" Mollie snapped her
fingers decisively. "It's a long chance and it
may not work at all but&mdash;are you game to try
it?" She paused and regarded the expectant girls
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Betty, noncommittally. "You
might tell us the idea first."</p>

<p>"Listen," cried Mollie. "My idea is that if
we take the hermit by surprise, call him by his
name of Paul Loup. Why&mdash;" She paused, and
the light of inspiration filled her eyes. "I could
even speak to him in French&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>As the girls caught her full meaning they looked
at her admiringly.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if that plan would work,"
said Betty swiftly. "Why can't we go now?
Dinner won't be ready for a couple of hours."</p>

<p>"Right you are," cried Mollie, taking the four
steps at one jump and springing upon her astonished
horse. "Come on, girls, are you with us?"</p>

<p>"We'll have to lead 'em a merry pace," said
Betty to Mollie a moment later as they galloped
abreast up the road. "If we don't get them there
in a hurry they're apt to get cold feet and think
we're crazy."</p>

<p>"Maybe we are," chuckled Mollie, urging Old
Nick on to even greater speed. "I've had a suspicion
that way several times before."</p>

<p>It was Betty's turn to chuckle.</p>

<p>"So have I!" she said, adding with a sigh of
resignation: "But oh, it is so much fun. Look
behind, Mollie. Are they still coming?"</p>

<p>"Strong," reported Mollie, with a glance over
her shoulder. Then, as they reached the trail
that led through the woods, she reined in a little,
motioning for Betty to take the lead. "You
know the trail better," she said.</p>

<p>Over the rough woodland trail their progress
necessarily became slower, a fact which the girls
did not relish at all. It gave them time to reflect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
on what a really rash adventure they had embarked,
and any but the Outdoor Girls might have
turned back even at this last minute.</p>

<p>However, curiosity, together with some vague
hope that they might become of service to this
strange sad fellow, urged them on. If Paul
Loup and the Hermit of Gold Run were really
one and the same person, then surely there was
a real mystery which they might in some way
help to unravel.</p>

<p>They did not linger any longer on the way
than was absolutely necessary, for the terrible
experience they had had with the timber wolves
soon after their arrival had made them suspicious
of the forest, and try as they would they could
not suppress an uncomfortable desire to search
every shadow for some sinister, lurking presence.</p>

<p>In vain had the cowboys on the ranch assured
them that wolves were very scarce in this part of
the forest, especially in the summer, and that they
had had an unusual and unique experience. As
Amy had said, one experience like that was
enough to last a lifetime.</p>

<p>They came in sight of the cabin without mishap,
however, and they tethered their horses a little
farther from the house than usual, so that
their stamping and neighing might not frighten
the hermit away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they made their way with as little noise
as possible along the narrow path.</p>

<p>"Suppose he isn't at home?" whispered Mollie
to Betty.</p>

<p>"Then we're out of luck, that's all," returned
Betty cheerfully.</p>

<p>But the hermit was at home. They could see
him moving about, and as they came nearer they
smelled an appetizing odor of frying bacon, as
though he were cooking his dinner.</p>

<p>"Hope he asks us to stay to lunch," said Grace,
and the girls giggled nervously.</p>

<p>"We'll be lucky if he doesn't slam the door in
our faces," said Amy pessimistically.</p>

<p>It was Mollie who knocked this time&mdash;and it
was no timid little rap either, but a good, hearty
rat-at-tat, that brought the occupant of the cabin
to the door in a hurry. He had the frying pan
still clutched in his hand and on his long narrow
face was such a look of dread that the girls felt
sorry for him.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, the emotion within him making
his voice sound stern and forbidding, "what is it
you wish? It is not raining to-day as it was that
other time." He gazed significantly up at the
cloudless sky seen in little blue patches through
the trees, and the girls flushed, partly from embarrassment
and partly from anger. Somehow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
they had not been prepared to have him take this
attitude, and they resented it.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood miserably tongue-tied.
Even their usually quick-witted Little Captain
seemed suddenly to have been stricken speechless.
They were just about to turn and run when
Mollie saved the day for them.</p>

<p>Pushing forward through the group she confronted
the man on the door step.</p>

<p>"<i>Vous &ecirc;tes Paul Loup, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?</i>"
she said in a clear voice, gazing up at
him fearlessly.</p>

<p>While the girls gasped at her temerity a most
astounding thing happened. The man dropped
the frying pan and it clattered to the floor, its
contents spilling out greasily. While they looked
he seemed to crumple, shrivel, and his eyes stared
at them glassily out of his white mask of a face.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" he cried hoarsely, staggering
back into the shack. "You have found me!
But I swear to you I did not kill him. <i>Mon Dieu</i>,
I could not kill my brother!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>A STARTLING TALE</h3>


<p>Hardly able to believe that they were actually
living this weird thing, the girls crowded into the
shack after the stricken man and found that he
had sunk upon a bench and covered his face with
his hands.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, though it had been Mollie
who had precipitated this thing, it was Betty who
now took the lead. Softly she went over to the
shrinking man and put a gentle hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"You say you did not kill your brother?" she
questioned in so calm a voice that the girls marveled
at her. "You are sure you did not?"</p>

<p>"No! no!" cried the man again raising his
haggard face, deep-lined with the marks of suffering,
"No&mdash;I am not sure. Can you not see?
It is that that is killing me. Yet in my sane
moments I know that he was dead. He lay there,
so white, so still, with only that red, red stream
of blood to mar his whiteness. I leaned down,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
I listened to his heart&mdash;&mdash;" The man had evidently
forgotten the presence of the girls, engulfed
as he was in the horror of the incident he related.
Once more he was living the tragedy, and the
girls, tense, strained, horrified, lived it with him.</p>

<p>"I listened to his heart," the man repeated, his
arms stretched out before him, his long, delicate
hands gripped with a fierceness that made the
knuckles go white. "There was no beating. I
put my face close to his mouth to see if there was
breath. But he had stopped breathing&mdash;forever!</p>

<p>"My heart went cold. I seized him by the
shoulders. I called him by his name&mdash;that
brother that I had loved! Oh, how I had loved
him. I begged him to come back to me, to open
those gray lips that a moment before had been
beautiful with life&mdash;to speak to me&mdash;and all the
time&mdash;&mdash;" his hand relaxed and pointed to the
floor and the girls followed the movement fascinated&mdash;"there
kept spreading and spreading on
the rug a deep red stain&mdash;my brother's blood!
<i>Mon Dieu!</i> And when I staggered to my feet
I found that the horrible stuff had clung to my
fingers&mdash;they were dark and sticky&mdash;the fingers
of a murderer! I went mad then, I think. I
rushed from the house, from the place. One
thing only was in my mind. To get away&mdash;to get
away from Paris, that accursed city&mdash;&mdash;" He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
paused, staring at the floor, and the girls waited,
hardly daring to move for fear they would break
the spell.</p>

<p>"The rest is like a bad dream to me," the man
continued in a weary voice. "Ghost-ridden,
haunted, I came to this country incognito&mdash;under
what you call an assumed name. For a short
time I stayed in New Orleans&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But your violin!" Betty interrupted in a voice
that amazed her, it seemed so little and weak.
"Surely you were under contract."</p>

<p>The man turned on her what was almost a
pitying look from his sunken eyes.</p>

<p>"I could not play," he said, with a shrug of
his shoulders. "To have gone to my manager
would have been like going to the hangman&mdash;the
electric chair, what you have in this country. No,
mademoiselle, I was a murderer, a man hunted
by his fellowmen. There was but one thing
for me to do&mdash;to hide, to dodge about like a rabbit
from a pack of baying dogs. Hide!" he
added bitterly. "I could not hide from myself.</p>

<p>"Always when the night grows dark and the
wind it makes to howl around this place I can
hear my brother's voice uplifted in anger. We
quarreled over something my uncle had said&mdash;a
foolish quarrel. He called me liar, and I&mdash;something
snapped in my brain, I think, and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a moment everything went red. There was a
wine bottle on the table&mdash;we had been drinking&mdash;blindly
I struck out with it&mdash;&mdash; Now, when
the darkness comes and the wildcat calls into the
night with a scream like a soul in torment, I hear
again the tinkling of that bottle as it shattered,
the short groan, the falling of a heavy body.</p>

<p>"It is a wonder that I have not gone mad," he
said. "Many a time I have prayed that I might
or that I might find courage to end this miserable
life and go to join my brother. But I am a
coward, a coward&mdash;&mdash;" His voice lowered till
it was almost inaudible and tears trickled through
the long white fingers. "I have not the courage
even to die. There is a tribunal above that I
should have to face, more just, more awful, than
any man-made law. There you have what Paul
Loup has become."</p>

<p>"But you must not speak that way," said Betty,
whose quick mind had been forging ahead while
the man had been speaking. "It is one thing to
kill a man deliberately, and quite another to kill
in hot blood, blindly. Besides," she added eagerly,
"you are not even sure that you did kill
your brother. Did you&mdash;have you seen the papers
since&mdash;since you ran away?"</p>

<p>"No," said the man. His tone was dead, hopeless.
"I was afraid of what I might find there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
He was dead, Mademoiselle," he added wearily.
"When I say that there is a doubt of that it is
simply to give myself one little excuse for continuing
to live. He did not move, he did not
breathe. Ah, yes, he was dead, quite dead."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment while Betty
thought rapidly. Amy and Mollie and Grace
stared wide-eyed with the feeling that they
were witnessing some tremendous, swift-moving
drama.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the man, breaking the silence
abruptly, his somber eyes upon Betty, "there
is but one thing left for me now to do. I shall
surrender to the authorities&mdash;a thing which I
should have done long ago. Or," he added
grimly, "you might rather go with me now. If
you left me I might attempt to escape&mdash;so you
will think, Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>There was a lift at the end of the sentence that
made it a question and, startled, the girls looked
at Betty to see what she would say.</p>

<p>The Little Captain herself was startled. Evidently
the man thought they had been tracking
him, had used their knowledge to trap him.</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't as you think!" she cried impulsively.
"We never had the slightest little wish
to harm you. And please, please," she added
earnestly, "don't give yourself up to the authori<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>ties,
or do anything rash until you hear from me
again. You may not believe me&mdash;I wouldn't
blame you if you didn't&mdash;&mdash;" she went on shyly,
for the man had risen and was staring at her,
"but all we want to do is to help you if we
can&mdash;&mdash;" she broke off confusedly for the look
in the man's eyes silenced her.</p>

<p>"You know I am Paul Loup," he cried hoarsely.
"You have heard my story, my confession from
my own lips, and still you say that you wish me
no harm! Who are you? what are you? what
do you want of me?" He had advanced toward
them, and in a panic the girls moved back toward
the open door. Only Betty stood fearlessly
in his path.</p>

<p>"We are the Outdoor Girls, and we are living
just at present on Gold Run Ranch," she said
quietly. "We found out who you were because
you were good enough to play for us at a benefit
we gave at the Hostess House at Camp Liberty
some time ago. And we came up here because
we thought that you were in trouble and that
we might help you. If we can't help you, I'm
sorry." And with head bravely uplifted Betty
turned toward the door.</p>

<p>She had almost reached it when he called to
her.</p>

<p>"You are a brave girl," said Paul Loup slowly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
his eyes intent on Betty's pretty face, "How do
you know that I&mdash;the murderer&mdash;will not kill you
also for this knowledge you have of me?"</p>

<p>Betty heard the frightened gasp of the girls behind
her, but, strangely enough, she herself felt
no fear.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't do that," she said, her clear
gaze holding his burning one. "You could not
wish harm to a friend."</p>

<p>"Is that what you wish me to consider you&mdash;a friend?"
asked the strange man, feeling suddenly
as though something warm and vital had
closed about his heart.</p>

<p>"If you will," replied Betty, reaching out her
hand. "I would like very much to be."</p>

<p>But Paul Loup, for all he was a murderer and
an outcast, was also a Frenchman. With a quick
gesture, ignoring her outstretched hand he caught
her in his arms, held her there for a minute,
then, releasing her, kissed her gently, first on
one cheek, then on the other.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten there were kind hearts in
the world," he murmured brokenly, turning from
her. "You have restored my faith. <i>Au revoir</i>,
my friend."</p>

<p>Someway, somehow, the girls found themselves
outside that little cabin, making their way blindly
down the path to where their horses were tethered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
In a daze they mounted and rode off down the
trail.</p>

<p>When they came to the open trail they found
that Betty was crying, openly, unashamed. Mollie
pushed a handkerchief into her hand, but the
Little Captain did not seem to notice it. She
stared straight ahead, her cheeks burning, the
tears rolling unchecked down her face.</p>

<p>"Never mind, honey," said Mollie, trying to
steady her voice. "It was hard for you, I know;
but I would give anything I own to have made
him feel that way about me. I don't care if he
did commit murder. I'm for him&mdash;strong."</p>

<p>"To be all alone," said Betty as though Mollie
had not spoken, "and so heart-hungry that a little
sympathy from a stranger&mdash;&mdash;" A sob choked
the rest of her sentence. But a moment later
she faced the girls with a light of resolve shining
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Girls," she said, "I don't believe Paul Loup
is a murderer, and some way or other I'm going
to prove it. A man like that just couldn't commit
murder. I know it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>THE PLAN</h3>


<p>Certainly the girls had never expected such
startling developments from Mollie's simple little
ruse to find out who the mysterious Hermit of
Gold Run was. In the beginning it had been
something of a lark, and they never dreamed that
their interest and curiosity would uncover such
a tragedy.</p>

<p>However, they were not at all in sympathy with
Betty's conviction that Paul Loup had not really
killed his brother.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you get that way, Betty,"
Grace argued hotly. "We all feel as sorry for the
hermit as you do, but we have his own word for
it that he really killed his brother."</p>

<p>"He did seem to be pretty sure of it," said
Amy, with a quaver in her voice. "When the
wind rose last night and wailed around the house,
I got all creepy thinking of him alone up in that
dreary little shack, living that whole horrible thing
over again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the next day, and the girls were in the
saddle, as usual. They had visited the new gold
diggings and found everybody excited and optimistic,
though no gold had been uncovered as
yet. And now they were trotting slowly along
the open road, their thoughts busy with the startling
happenings of the day before.</p>

<p>"It's a wonder he doesn't go crazy," shuddered
Mollie, taking up the thread where Amy had
dropped it. "I know I would. What was it
he said about being 'ghost-ridden?'"</p>

<p>"I don't believe he is ghost-ridden at all, except
by his imagination," said Betty positively.
"I think if he had taken the trouble to look at
the newspapers before he decided that he was a
hunted man he might have saved himself a lot
of trouble and unhappiness."</p>

<p>"Goodness, how do you get that way, Betty?"
Grace said irritably. "The man ought to be the
best judge of whether he killed anybody or
not."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Little Captain stubbornly, "it
seems to me it would have had to be a pretty
heavy bottle with a pretty strong arm behind it
to kill a man with one blow. And a scalp wound
bleeds horribly, you know."</p>

<p>The girls looked a little thoughtful, and for
the first time since Betty had advanced her theory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
they began to think that there might possibly be
something in it after all.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Amy, and then went on to
relate an experience she had had when skylarking
with Sarah Stonington.</p>

<p>"She had hold of that heavy rocking chair we
have in the library," Amy said. "She was trying
to pull it away from me, and I was hanging
on to it for dear life.</p>

<p>"Then suddenly I let go, and Aunt Sarah&mdash;she's
pretty heavy, you know&mdash;lost her balance as
the chair swung forward, and fell over backward,
striking her head on the sharp edge of the
piano."</p>

<p>"Goodness, you must have been scared," commented
Mollie.</p>

<p>"'Scared!'" echoed Amy. "Why, I was
struck dumb with terror. I thought I had killed
her. She lay there all white and funny, and her
head was bleeding dreadfully&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's your scalp wound for you," Betty
pointed out. "Just a little scratch will make the
whole place look like a shambles."</p>

<p>"But what happened to your aunt Sarah, Amy,"
pursued Mollie interestedly. "We know she
didn't die."</p>

<p>"Well, I should say she didn't!" said Amy
roundly. "She was as good as ever in ten min<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>utes
and laughing at me for being so frightened.
But we had to have the rug sent away to get
the stain out," she added significantly.</p>

<p>"Huh," said the girls, and once more became
thoughtful.</p>

<p>"But suppose you were right, Betty?" said
Mollie, after a while. "Suppose our poor musician
is torturing himself by thinking he has committed
a crime that he hasn't? What could you
possibly do about it?"</p>

<p>"I don't just know," Betty admitted truthfully.</p>

<p>"We might ask your father," Grace hazarded,
but Betty turned on her, startled.</p>

<p>"That's just the thing I don't want to do!"
she said hurriedly. "Dad is just the best and
most easy-going father in the world, but he has
a terribly stern sense of justice. I'm not sure he
wouldn't think we were making ourselves&mdash;oh,
what do you call it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Accessaries'">Accessories</ins> after the fact?" suggested Mollie,
helpfully.</p>

<p>"That's it," said Betty. "He might argue that
we were committing a crime ourselves by helping
to hide a criminal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe we are, at that," said Grace, uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"They can put you in jail for that sort of thing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
can't they?" added Amy, a suggestion which certainly
did not add to the cheerfulness of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Betty stoutly. "I'd rather
go to jail than deliver a man to a doubtful justice&mdash;especially
when he may really be innocent.
Anyway," she added, reasonably: "who is there
to know that we went to Paul Loup's cabin the
other day? I'm very sure no one saw us go in
or come out, and if we keep quiet no one will
have to know. That's why I didn't even want
to take dad into our confidence."</p>

<p>"But if our musician is, as you think, innocent,"
Grace insisted, "then your father could do
more for him than we."</p>

<p>"But we don't know that he is innocent. That's
only my idea," said Betty. "And dad would
probably think it was a very foolish one. Maybe
it is, for all I know," she added dubiously.</p>

<p>"How about Allen?" said Grace suddenly after
another rather long silence. "He would certainly
sympathize with our poor hermit and, being a
lawyer, he would probably be able to think up
some way that we might establish the man's innocence
or guilt without giving away his whereabouts.
There, how's that for a brilliant idea?"
she finished proudly.</p>

<p>"I had already thought of that," admitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Betty, while the girls turned amused eyes upon
her. "But I was almost afraid to suggest
it."</p>

<p>"Maybe Allen would agree with your father
that we, ought to turn him over to justice," said
Mollie, but Betty shook her head vigorously.</p>

<p>"Never! Not Allen!" she declared fervently.
"He believes the other fellow innocent until he
is proved guilty."</p>

<p>"So does the law," said Amy wisely.</p>

<p>"Yes, but the law has sent many an innocent
man to prison nevertheless," retorted Mollie.
"We don't always find justice in the courts."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear," cried Grace. "Get a soap box,
Mollie."</p>

<p>"Then it is settled that we are to tell Allen,
is it?" said Betty eagerly. "I'm sure he will
find some way to help us."</p>

<p>"If we can pry him loose from the mining outfit,"
laughed Mollie. "He seems to have gold
fever worse than any of them."</p>

<p>But Allen had been busy, during the intervals
when he could tear himself away from the
fascination of the mining operations, on some
legal matters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson, and her husband also, had feared
that these numerous relatives of her great uncle,
of whose existence she herself had scarcely been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
aware, might see fit to contest the old man's will
especially when it became apparent that his property
at this time was far more valuable than it
had been at the time of his death.</p>

<p>Allen, after considerable investigation, was able
to set their fears at rest upon this point, however,
by asserting that the old gentleman had made
only one will and that he thought it very doubtful
under the circumstances that the relatives would
take the case into the courts. They were not
Mr. Barcolm's children and grandchildren, as
Lizzie had supposed, but distant relatives whom
at one time and another the old man had befriended
and gathered about him, but who had
later quarreled with their benefactor.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Mrs. Nelson decided happily, "if
we really do find some gold I will give each one
of them a share of it, even to the littlest."</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon the girls found
Allen, not at the mines as they supposed they
would, but at the ranch house busy with some
papers.</p>

<p>When they besought him to come out for a ride,
he hesitated at first, saying that he ought to get
his work done before night. But they finally
persuaded him not to let duty interfere with
pleasure.</p>

<p>"All right," he surrendered at last. "If you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
will get one of the boys to saddle Lightning for
me I will be with you in ten minutes."</p>

<p>He kept his promise, and in a short time was
listening to the strangest tale he had ever heard.
As he listened his face became more and more
serious.</p>

<p>"But, girls, this thing sounds impossible!" he
burst forth, finally. "Are you telling me that
you, alone and unprotected, managed to inveigle
this murderer into confessing his crime to you?
Gee, it's&mdash;it's unbelievable! The four of you
would be a great help to me in my profession,"
he added, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"I didn't think you would take it as a joke,"
said Betty, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"It isn't a joke," returned Allen, his face grave
again. "It's a mighty serious business, if you
will excuse my saying so. It makes me sick
when I think of the chance you took." He was
speaking to all the girls, but his look of concern
was for Betty.</p>

<p>"Oh, we don't want to think about ourselves,"
said the latter, impatiently. "We've done a good
deal more dangerous things than that in our lives.
We thought&mdash;we hoped&mdash;you might help us to
prove his innocence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the man's guilty," said Allen, surprised.
"We have that by his own confession&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>With a glance of despair at the others, Betty
interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Allen," she said. "This is
what I think&mdash;&mdash;" And she went on to tell him
her idea while he listened, at first with a smile of
faint amusement on his lips which gradually
changed to grave admiration as he realized Betty's
unfailing faith in the basic goodness of human
nature.</p>

<p>"I hope you are right, little girl," he said at
last, when she had finished and was looking at
him earnestly. "I'd like to believe you were
right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you can't?" she finished for him, trying
to stifle the disappointment in her heart.</p>

<p>"No, I can't," he answered truthfully. "When
a man is so sure of his crime that he flees his
own country, gives up money and fame to escape
the law, you may be pretty sure that his crime
was a real one."</p>

<p>"But, Allen, you don't know the man," Betty
pleaded, pretty close to tears in the bitterness of
her disappointment. "No one could make the
kind of music he does and be truly wicked. I
wish you could have met him. I think you would
have tried a little harder to help him."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to help him, if I can," Allen answered
gently, feeling that he would be almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
willing to step into this poor musician's place if
he might have Betty plead for him as she had
just done for the other. "What is it you would
like me to do?"</p>

<p>Then suddenly the great idea popped full grown
into Betty's head.</p>

<p>"I have it!" she cried. "Why not write to Paul
Loup's manager in New York and ask him for
particulars?"</p>

<p>"Capital!" replied Allen approvingly, while the
girls looked at their Little Captain admiringly.
"If anybody ought to be able to give us information,
he surely is the one."</p>

<p>"And, Allen," begged Betty, reining her horse
close to Allen and laying a timid hand on his
arm, "you won't even whisper a word of what
we've told you&mdash;not for your foolish old law,
or anything else?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Allen, smiling at her.
"We have to give the poor fellow his chance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>GREAT DAYS</h3>


<p>That very afternoon Allen composed a letter
to Paul Loup's concert manager&mdash;advised and
censored by the girls, of course&mdash;and they all
rode off to town to mail it in time to catch the
four o'clock outgoing mail.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mollie, as, this duty well performed,
they started back to the ranch, "I feel better.
We've started something, anyway."</p>

<p>"Let's hope that we can finish it," added Grace,
dubiously.</p>

<p>They did not expect an answer to this epistle
within ten days, and in the meantime they found
plenty to keep them busy around the ranch.</p>

<p>Progress at the mines was swift, and almost
any minute now they might expect to hear the
glorious tidings that some one had "struck it
rich."</p>

<p>Nothing had been seen of Peter Levine since
that memorable night when the map had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
taken from him, and it was rumored that the rascally
lawyer had left town.</p>

<p>"And the longer he keeps away the healthier
it will be for him, I reckon," Allen said, adding
with a laugh: "Gee, but it makes me happy
every time I think of how sore that chap may
be."</p>

<p>Betty had dimpled sympathetically.</p>

<p>"You have an awfully mean disposition, Allen,"
she chided him.</p>

<p>Meggy and Dan Higgins were working furiously
at their mine, but after a few days Betty
was quick to see that they were not progressing
as well as some of the others. After all Meggy,
though unusually strong and robust for her age,
was only a girl and her father was an old man
who had just about worn out his energies in a
fruitless search for fortune.</p>

<p>Betty had besought her father to send help to
these good friends of hers, and Mr. Nelson had
immediately complied.</p>

<p>There had been some trouble with Dan at first&mdash;with
Meggy too, for that matter.</p>

<p>"We can't take nothin' thet we can't pay fer,
sir," the old fellow assured Mr. Nelson positively.
But the latter reminded him that he and Meggy
had saved his daughter's life, as well as those of
the other girls, and that this put him, Mr. Nel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>son,
deeply in the others' debt. In view of this
the old fellow finally surrendered. In his heart
he was deeply, fervently thankful for the help
of the young, able-bodied man whom Mr. Nelson
provided and for whose services he paid.</p>

<p>"But ef I strike thet thar gold vein, sir," Dan
assured Mr. Nelson earnestly, "I'm goin' to make
it up to you, sir, every cent of it."</p>

<p>"All right, we can talk about that later," Mr.
Nelson said, and laughed and walked on to view
his own operations, feeling that he had done a
very good day's work.</p>

<p>One morning, as the girls mounted their horses
and turned their heads in the direction of the
gold diggings, they heard what seemed to be wild
cheering and shouting in the distance and with
one impulse they urged their horses to a gallop.</p>

<p>"Somebody's found something!" shouted Mollie,
as the cheering and shouting became more
distinct. "Oh, girls, I wonder who it is."</p>

<p>"Maybe a mine has caved in, or something,"
Grace called back, pessimistically. "You'd better
not get too happy, all at once."</p>

<p>"You old wet-blanket!" cried Betty, as she
leaned forward and whispered in Nigger's ear,
urging him to greater speed. "That kind of mine
doesn't cave in very often. Oh, Nigger, hurry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
old boy! Don't you know we've got to get there
quickly?"</p>

<p>As they approached the noise became tumultuous,
and as they topped a small hill that brought
them in full view of the new diggings they saw
a sight that they would never forget as long as
they lived.</p>

<p>They gazed on what seemed to be a mob gone
wild. Men grasped each other around the waists,
performing some kind of crazy dance that looked
like an Indian cakewalk. Others tossed their
hats in the air and shot holes through them as
they fell to the ground. And all were laughing,
crying, shouting, waving arms and head gear
in a sort of wild, feverish, primal jubilation.</p>

<p>The girls caught the thrill of it and they tingled
to their finger tips. Putting spurs to their horses,
they galloped down into the thick of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>THE END OF PETER LEVINE</h3>


<p>The crowd scattered as the Outdoor Girls
came whirling down into its midst, but in an instant
it had closed about them again. They dismounted,
leaving their excited horses to go where
they would, and pushed their way through to the
group that seemed to be the center of all this
wild demonstration.</p>

<p>And when they saw Meggy, fairly weeping with
joy, and old Dan Higgins, holding a handful of
precious golden nuggets, they nearly went mad
themselves.</p>

<p>They kissed and hugged Meggy till she cried
aloud for mercy. They kissed and hugged old
Dan, and he took it as though he had been used
to being made much of by pretty girls all his
life.</p>

<p>Twenty years had fallen from the old man's
age. No matter that he had wasted the best part
of his life in a vain hunt for gold. His dream
had been realized at last. There was a fortune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in his grasp, and he felt again the thrill that
had coursed through his veins when, as a young
man, heart high with aspirations, he had started
on his quest.</p>

<p>He was young again! Young! It seemed as
though the sight of those golden nuggets&mdash;his
own&mdash;had renewed the fires of youth.</p>

<p>Nimbly he sprang upon an empty powder
keg and addressed his frenzied audience.</p>

<p>"Friends and fellow gold hunters," he yelled,
and there was a roar of appreciation. "They is a
few words I'd like to say afore we go back to
wrestlin' some more gold outen them rocks. An'
these is them. Ef I'm a happy man to-day an' a
rich one, then it's all due to these four young
gals here. They set me on the trail o' this new
thing when I was purty near tuckered out. You
all knows 'em an' loves 'em. Now give 'em a
cheer. Hearty, now, hearty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then arose such a roar that the Outdoor Girls'
hearts swelled near to bursting and they felt
the tears sting their eyes. That moment would
be something to remember all their lives.</p>

<p>The roar gradually subsided and the miners
wandered back to their own operations again,
followed by scattered groups of curious onlookers.
They worked with redoubled energy, with
redoubled hope. Gold had been found. More<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
gold would be found. It was a thrilling, glorious
race to see who would be the next to announce
good fortune.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, the girls crowded around
Meggy, questioning her, congratulating her, demanding
to know how it had all happened and
when.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my mouth is so dry I can hardly speak,"
said Meggy, quivering with nervous reaction.
"I&mdash;I can't jest make up my mind that it has
happened yet."</p>

<p>"We know," said Betty, soothingly. "You
needn't tell us about it if you don't want to."</p>

<p>"But I do&mdash;I've got <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'too'">to</ins>!" cried Meggy tensely.
"Why, it seems like a dream. But I'm so happy,
so wildly happy&mdash;&mdash;" A sob caught in her throat
and she paused for a moment, then went on
swiftly, the words tumbling over each other in
her eagerness: "It was jest this morning that
it happened, jest a little while ago. You know we
have been workin' awful hard the last few days,
an' I was getting worried over dad again. He
was gittin' that thin an' weak an' kind o' discouraged,
too. Seemed like he'd jest made up
his mind that there wasn't no luck fer him nowhere's.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;&mdash;" she leaned forward, her eyes
black as coals, her fingers clasped convulsively in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
front of her. "Then we uncovered it, that first
little narrow vein o' gold runnin' through the
rocks. I thought dad would go plumb crazy
when he seen it. Honest, I was skeered for a
minute, till I recollected thet joy never killed nobody.</p>

<p>"Then I began to be skeered fer myself. I
felt so kind o' queer an' wobbly inside o' me.
Then dad came runnin' out to show the other
fellers what he'd found, an' seemed like they went
crazy too.</p>

<p>"Then you come an'&mdash;an'&mdash;I guess thet's 'bout
all."</p>

<p>The girls drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"All," repeated Grace, softly. "I should think
it was about enough for one day!"</p>

<p>"An' now," said Meggy, in a small little voice,
"poor old dad an' me, we're rich&mdash;rich! Think
of it&mdash;Meggy an' her dad! Now I can buy a hoss
like&mdash;like&mdash;Nigger, mebbe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You funny girl," cried Betty, hugging her
fondly. "Of course you can buy a horse&mdash;a
dozen of them if you want to. But wouldn't you
like anything else? Pretty clothes, a beautiful
house to live in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Meggy, but without any special
enthusiasm. "I used to think when you gals
come around lookin' all pretty an' stylish in your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
nice clothes thet I would like to dress thet way
myself ef I wasn't as poor as dirt. An' I would
like to live in somethin' besides a shack an' have
sheets enough to your beds so's you could change
'em every day ef you wanted to. Sure, I'd like
them things.</p>

<p>"But a hoss&mdash;&mdash;" Her voice lowered almost
to a reverential pitch. "Ever sence I grew to be
a long-legged gal, seems like all I've really wanted
was a hoss. I s'pose," she turned dark, rather
wistful eyes on the girls, "it's purty hard for you
gals to understand what I'm talkin' about. You
never longed fer a thing so's your heart ached
till it seemed like it was dead inside of you. So
you might think I was foolish to take on so 'bout
only a hoss."</p>

<p>"We don't think you're foolish, Meggy," said
Betty, gently. "We think you're wonderful, and
you deserve every bit of the splendid luck that
has come to you. And I expect," she finished
gayly, "that you will have the most beautiful horse
in all Gold Run."</p>

<p>Meggy's eyes lighted with joy. Then they
misted suddenly as she looked at the girls.</p>

<p>"It's jest like dad said," she murmured. "We
wouldn't 'a' had nothin' ef it hadn't been fer you
girls. You don't know how we feel about you,
'cause we jest never could tell you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The days that followed seemed like a beautiful
fairy tale to the happy girls. Peter Levine had
known what he was talking about when he had
asserted that "gold was running wild" about the
northern end of the ranch and its environs.</p>

<p>It was as though the finding of gold in the
new Higgins' mine had been the key that unlocked
the door to a steady stream of it.</p>

<p>Every day brought glad tidings of a new find,
and, as some of these were on the ranch, Betty
began to realize that the Nelson family was becoming
very wealthy. They had always been
well-to-do, for her father had prospered in his
business, that of carpet manufacturer in Deepdale.
But now it seemed that they were to know what
it felt like to be really rich.</p>

<p>The girls realized this, and once Mollie put the
new idea into words.</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful thing for you, Betty
dear," she said soberly. "You can have about
anything in the world that you want now. I&mdash;I&mdash;hope
you won't forget your old friends." She
said the last laughingly, but Betty was deeply
hurt and showed that she was.</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if you ever dare say such a horrid thing
to me again, Mollie Billette," she cried, half way
between tears and anger, "I'll never, never forgive
you! You&mdash;you&mdash;ought to know me better."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>And Mollie, heartily ashamed of herself, succeeded
in placating the Little Captain only after
having apologized most abjectly.</p>

<p>Then one day something happened that amused
them all mightily. They had all turned out to the
gold diggings, Mrs. Nelson, Mr. Nelson, the four
girls, and Allen. Mrs. Nelson and Allen were
engaged in the joyful pursuit of trying to figure
out how much her profits would be, when Betty
edged up to Allen and, pulling his sleeve, pointed
out a man some distance from them. The latter
was standing alone, and he seemed to be regarding
the operations rather morosely.</p>

<p>"Peter Levine, by all that's holy!" murmured
Allen. "Just hold tight for a minute, folks, and
watch me chase him."</p>

<p>With an elaborately casual air, Allen sauntered
over to the morose individual. The man looked
up as he approached, and the scowl on his face
deepened.</p>

<p>"Howdy," said Allen, loud enough to cause
those near by to turn to look at him. "How's
my old friend Levine this morning?"</p>

<p>"None of your business," snarled the other,
with a black look. "Lay off me, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I hear," said Allen, loudly and cheerfully.
"I'm quite exceptionally good at hearing.
Shall I tell these friends of ours what Andy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Rawlinson and I happened to hear the other
night, beneath these very trees? Why, Levine,
where are you going?" he asked with feigned
surprise, as the other started to take his leave.
"Don't you want to hear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth!" snarled Peter Levine, furiously,
then turned and slunk off, followed by
the jeers and catcalls of the crowd.</p>

<p>"You shore hev got his number, boy," said
one old timer, admiringly. "He loves you like
the fox loves a trap."</p>

<p>Allen grinned boyishly. "Suits me!" he said
cheerfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>INNOCENT</h3>


<p>"That was good, Allen," said Mr. Nelson appreciatively,
as the young fellow rejoined the
group. "You've licked him in fine shape."</p>

<p>"And we want to thank you for the way you
have handled things for us, Allen," added Mrs.
Nelson, warmly. "We might have got into all
sorts of trouble if it hadn't been for you."</p>

<p>The young lawyer was tremendously embarrassed
by this praise, though Betty was aglow
with it. It was splendid to have her family so
fond of Allen.</p>

<p>The latter noticed her silence, and under cover
of the general conversation commented upon it.</p>

<p>"How feels the millionairess this morning?" he
asked lightly, though Betty felt that there was a
deeper meaning hidden behind the words.</p>

<p>"I'm feeling splendid," she answered, her voice
vibrating with the joy of living. "Who wouldn't
be&mdash;with all this?" and she waved her hand over
the bustling scene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the excitement of all these wonderful
happenings, the girls, especially Betty, had
thought almost constantly of the poor musician
whom his neighbors called the Hermit of Gold
Run.</p>

<p>He never came down to help Dan Higgins and
Meggy any more, probably, Grace said, scared
off by the bustle and confusion of the new
gold boom. Meggy had mentioned casually
once or twice that she still took food to the desperate
man.</p>

<p>"If he only doesn't give himself up to the
authorities before we get news from the East!"
Betty, worried, exclaimed over and over again.</p>

<p>Then one day, along with the other letters in
the mail, there arrived an important looking document
from New York addressed to Allen.</p>

<p>The latter was out at the gold diggings at the
time, and the girls fairly lassoed him, bringing
him home protesting but helpless.</p>

<p>"I say, what's the row?" he demanded, and
for answer Mollie thrust the important missive
into his hand.</p>

<p>"Read!" she commanded dramatically. "And
tell us what lies within."</p>

<p>Allen tore the envelope open and read the letter
hastily through while the girls crowded around
him and tried to read over his shoulder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he jumped to his feet and waved the paper
at them excitedly.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he cried, "this proves that Betty
was right. The man didn't kill his brother&mdash;simply
injured him. He was taken to the hospital
and he recovered long since. The manager
says he has been trying to locate Paul Loup for
weeks. He is losing a fortune every day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Betty could wait no longer. She snatched
the letter from him and read it through aloud
while the girls gaped at her.</p>

<p>"Come on," she cried, reaching for her sailor
hat and pushing it down on her shapely little
head. "Don't stand there like wooden Indians.
We've got to take this news to Paul Loup."</p>

<p>Bent on their joyful mission, the girls approached
the lonely little cabin in the woods
swiftly. As they came near they heard again
that same hauntingly sweet melody that had so
moved them the first time they had heard it.</p>

<p>Yet now that they understood the pain that
prompted the rendering of that exquisite harmony,
it seemed too bitterly sad to be beautiful,
and their hearts ached dully in sympathy with
Paul Loup's despair.</p>

<p>Tears were in Betty's eyes, but there was a
smile on her lips, as she pushed open the door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of the little shack and stood waiting on the threshold.</p>

<p>The musician saw her, ended the throbbing
melody with a crash of discord, and gazed at her
mutely. In all his tall, gaunt body only his glowing
eyes seemed really alive, but in those eyes
there was a welcome that gave Betty courage.</p>

<p>"Look!" she cried, holding out the paper to
him. "This is from your manager. Read it&mdash;and
see that you are innocent."</p>

<p>Slowly the man laid down his violin and bow,
slowly he took the paper from Betty's trembling
fingers. Like a man in a daze he read it through&mdash;then
read it through again.</p>

<p>"I did not kill him&mdash;my brother," he murmured
aloud. "My brother&mdash;that I love&mdash;I did not kill
him. He is alive&mdash;he is well. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, then
I am free! Paul Loup&mdash;he is not a murderer&mdash;a
hunted thing. He is again the artist&mdash;free&mdash;<i>free</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
His voice, which had been gradually
rising as the truth bore in upon him, rose to a
jubilant shout and he threw out his arms passionately
as though to encompass them all in his
newly found love of life. "The world&mdash;&mdash;" he
said brokenly, "the world is very beautiful!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Silently the girls rode through the sunshine and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
shadow-filled forest, their hearts filled with a happiness
so poignant it seemed almost pain.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful, wonderful summer!"
breathed Mollie. "I don't believe we have ever
had one like it, girls."</p>

<p>"I wish we didn't have to go home," sighed
Amy. "I shall miss my beautiful Lady so," and
she laid a loving hand on the little animal's
arching neck.</p>

<p>"What about me?" wailed Grace. "I know I
shall cry myself to sleep, longing for Nabob.
He's one of the best chums I ever had."</p>

<p>But the Little Captain did not hear them.
Over and over again, like an echo, her mind was
repeating those words of Paul Loup: "The
world is very beautiful."</p>

<p>"Girls," she murmured dreamily, "everybody
is so happy&mdash;and I'm so happy&mdash;oh, please, don't
wake me up&mdash;anybody!"</p>

<p>And so, at the end of a wonderful outing, with
life stretching gloriously before them, we will
once more sadly, reluctantly, wave farewell to the
Outdoor Girls.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
